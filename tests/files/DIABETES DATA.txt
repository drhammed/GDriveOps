What Is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough—or any—insulin, or doesn't use insulin properly. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.

Diabetes raises the risk for damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. Taking steps to prevent or manage diabetes may lower your risk of developing diabetes health problems.

What are the different types of diabetes?
The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes
If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.

Type 2 diabetes
If you have type 2 diabetes, the cells in your body don't use insulin properly. The pancreas may be making insulin but is not making enough insulin to keep your blood glucose level in the normal range. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you have risk factors, such as overweight or obesity, and a family history of the disease. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. You can help delay or prevent type 2 diabetes by knowing the risk factors and taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle, such as losing weight or preventing weight gain.

Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you've had gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is type 2 diabetes.

Prediabetes
People with prediabetes have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. You also have a higher risk for heart disease than people with normal glucose levels.

Other types of diabetes
A less common type of diabetes, called monogenic diabetes, is caused by a change in a single gene. Diabetes can also come from having surgery to remove the pancreas, or from damage to the pancreas due to conditions such as cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis.

How common are diabetes and prediabetes?
More than 133 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes. As of 2019, 37.3 million people—or 11.3% of the U.S. population—had diabetes. More than 1 in 4 people over the age of 65 had diabetes. Nearly 1 in 4 adults with diabetes didn't know they had the disease. About 90% to 95% of diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes. In 2019, 96 million adults—38% of U.S. adults—had prediabetes.

What other health problems can people with diabetes develop?
Over time, high blood glucose can damage your heart, kidneys, feet, and eyes. If you have diabetes, you can take steps to lower your chances of developing diabetes health problems by taking steps to improve your health and learning how to manage the disease. Managing your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels can help prevent future health problems.

Having diabetes means you are more likely to develop heart disease and to have a greater chance of a heart attack or a stroke. Over time, high blood glucose from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart. Adults with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to die from heart disease or stroke as people without diabetes. The good news is that the steps you take to manage your diabetes also help to lower your chances of having heart disease or a stroke.

Manage your A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Ask your health care team what your goals should be.
Develop or maintain healthy lifestyle habits. Follow your healthy eating plan and make physical activity part of your routine.
Learn ways to manage stress. Try deep breathing, gardening, taking a walk, doing yoga, or listening to your favorite music.
Stay on top of your medications. Take medicines as prescribed by your doctor.
Stop smoking or using other tobacco products. You can start by calling 1-800-QUITNOW or visiting smokefree.gov.

Diabetes Tests & Diagnosis
Who should be tested for diabetes?
Anyone who has symptoms of diabetes should be tested for the disease. Some people will not have any symptoms but may have risk factors for type 2 diabetes and need to be tested. Most pregnant women should also be tested for gestational diabetes. Testing helps doctors find diabetes sooner, so they can work with their patients to manage the disease and prevent health problems. If you have Medicare, it may cover the cost of tests if you have certain risk factors for diabetes. If you have different insurance, ask your insurance company if it covers diabetes tests.

Blood tests help doctors diagnose diabetes and prediabetes.
Type 1 diabetes
Doctors often diagnose type 1 diabetes in children and young adults when they have diabetes symptoms, such as feeling thirsty and having to urinate more often, or if they may have diabetic ketoacidosis. Symptoms in adults may be less specific. Type 1 diabetes can run in families. A study called TrialNet offers free testing to relatives of people with type 1 diabetes, even if the relatives don't have symptoms.

Type 2 diabetes
Experts recommend routine testing for type 2 diabetes if you have certain risk factors. You may have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you are

age 35 or older
American Indian, Black or African American, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander
overweight or have obesity and have at least one other risk factor
a woman who had gestational diabetes
Take the American Diabetes Association Diabetes Risk Test to see if you are at risk for type 2 diabetes.

Children can also develop type 2 diabetes. Experts recommend testing children and teens between the ages of 10 and 18 who are overweight or have obesity and have at least one more risk factor, such as a low birth weight, a parent who had diabetes while pregnant, or another factor. Adults and children with normal diabetes test results should be retested every 3 years. If your blood glucose levels are higher than the target range, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes, doctors will diagnose you with prediabetes. Having prediabetes is serious because it raises the chance of developing type 2 diabetes. But developing type 2 diabetes can be prevented. Adults and children diagnosed with prediabetes should be tested for type 2 diabetes every year.

Testing for type 2 diabetes before and during pregnancy
All women who are planning to get pregnant should be tested for type 2 diabetes, especially if they have risk factors. If you are already pregnant, you should be tested for type 2 diabetes at the first prenatal appointment, or in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. If you have diabetes, you should receive special care during your pregnancy to avoid problems for you and the baby.

Gestational diabetes
All pregnant women who do not have a previous diagnosis of diabetes should be tested for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If you have gestational diabetes, you should get tested after your baby is born to see if you have type 2 diabetes, usually within 12 weeks after delivery.

What tests are used to diagnose diabetes?
Doctors use a variety of tests to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes. Your doctor may recommend different tests depending on whether you have symptoms or not, or whether you are pregnant.

Fasting plasma glucose test
The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test measures your blood glucose level at a single point in time. For the most reliable results, your doctor will give you the test in the morning after you have fasted for at least 8 hours. Fasting means having nothing to eat or drink except sips of water.

A1C test
The A1C test is a blood test that provides your average levels of blood glucose over the last 3 months. Other names for the A1C test are hemoglobin A1C, HbA1C, glycated hemoglobin, and glycosylated hemoglobin test. You can eat and drink before this test. Before using the A1C test to diagnose diabetes, your doctor will consider factors, such as whether you are in your second or third trimester of pregnancy or whether you have certain types of anemia or another problem with your blood. The A1C test might not be accurate in those cases. Certain types of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin variants, can interfere with measuring A1C levels. Most A1C tests used in the United States are not affected by the most common variants. If your A1C test results and blood glucose levels do not match, your doctor should consider that the A1C test may not be a reliable test for you. Your doctor will report your A1C test result as a percentage, such as an A1C of 7%. The higher the percentage is, the higher your average blood glucose levels are.

Random plasma glucose test
Sometimes doctors use the random plasma glucose test to diagnose diabetes when you have symptoms of diabetes and they do not want to wait until you have fasted for 8 hours. You may have this blood test at any time.

Glucose challenge test
If you are pregnant, your doctor might test you for gestational diabetes with the glucose challenge test. Another name for this test is the glucose screening test. In this test, a health care professional will take a sample of your blood 1 hour after you drink a sweet liquid containing glucose. You do not need to fast for this test. If your blood glucose level is too high—135 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL or higher—you may need to return for an oral glucose tolerance test while fasting.

Oral glucose tolerance test
The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) helps doctors detect type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes. However, the OGTT is a more expensive test than the FPG test and the glucose challenge test, and it is not as easy to give. Before the test, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours. A health care professional will take a blood sample to measure your glucose level after fasting. Next, you will drink a liquid that is high in sugar. Another blood sample is taken 2 hours later to check your blood glucose level. If your blood glucose level is high, you may have diabetes. If you are pregnant, your blood will be drawn every hour for 2 to 3 hours. If your blood glucose levels are high two or more times during the OGTT, you may have gestational diabetes.

What test results tell me if I have diabetes or prediabetes?
Each test to detect diabetes and prediabetes uses a different measurement. Usually, your doctor will use a second test to confirm you have diabetes. The table below helps you understand what your test results mean if you are not pregnant. If you are pregnant, some tests use different cutoffs. Ask your doctor what your test results mean.

Test results for diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes:

Diagnosis	A1C	Fasting Plasma Glucose	Oral Glucose Tolerance Test*	Random Plasma Glucose Test+
Normal	below 5.7%	99 mg/dL or below	139 mg/dL or below	N/A
Prediabetes	5.7% to 6.4%	100 to 125 mg/dL	140 to 199 mg/dL	N/A
Diabetes	6.5% or above	126 mg/dL or above	200 mg/dL or above	200 mg/dL or above
2 hours after glucose intake
Used when there are symptoms

Which tests help my doctor know what kind of diabetes I have?
Even though the tests described above can confirm you have diabetes, they can't identify what type you have—type 1, type 2, or a rare type of diabetes called monogenic diabetes. Treatment can depend on the type of diabetes you have, so knowing which type you have is important.

Genetic testing
Genetic testing can diagnose most forms of monogenic diabetes, which is caused by a change—or mutation—in a gene. Anyone can have monogenic diabetes, but it is more common in babies who develop diabetes before they are 6 months old, some teens, and some young adults.

Autoantibodies
If you have diabetes, your doctor may look for certain autoantibodies to see if your diabetes is type 1. Autoantibodies are proteins in your immune system that mistakenly attack your healthy tissues and cells. A health care professional will take a sample of your blood for this test. If autoantibodies for diabetes are found in your blood, you may have type 1 diabetes. If you do not have diabetes but your parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes, your doctor might give you this test to see if you have a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes. You may want to learn about diabetes symptoms and have follow-up testing as recommended by your doctor.

Type 1 Diabetes: Symptoms and Causes
Overview
Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition. In this condition, the pancreas makes little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. Different factors, such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults. Even after a lot of research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. Treatment is directed toward managing the amount of sugar in the blood using insulin, diet, and lifestyle to prevent complications.

Symptoms
Type 1 diabetes symptoms can appear suddenly and may include:

Feeling more thirsty than usual
Urinating a lot
Bed-wetting in children who have never wet the bed during the night
Feeling very hungry
Losing weight without trying
Feeling irritable or having other mood changes
Feeling tired and weak
Having blurry vision
When to see a doctor
Talk to your health care provider if you notice any of the above symptoms in you or your child.

Causes
The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Usually, the body's own immune system which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses destroys the insulin-producing (islet) cells in the pancreas. Other possible causes include:

Genetics
Exposure to viruses and other environmental factors
The role of insulin
Once a large number of islet cells are destroyed, the body will produce little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas).

The pancreas puts insulin into the bloodstream.
Insulin travels through the body, allowing sugar to enter the cells.
Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.
As the blood sugar level drops, the pancreas puts less insulin into the bloodstream.
The role of glucose
Glucose, a sugar, is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.

Glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver.
Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.
The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen.
When glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down the stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps glucose levels within a typical range.
In type 1 diabetes, there's no insulin to let glucose into the cells. Because of this, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This can cause life-threatening complications.

Risk factors
Some factors that can raise your risk for type 1 diabetes include:

Family history. Anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly higher risk of developing the condition.
Genetics. Having certain genes increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes.
Geography. The number of people who have type 1 diabetes tends to be higher as you travel away from the equator.
Age. Type 1 diabetes can appear at any age, but it appears at two noticeable peaks. The first peak occurs in children between 4 and 7 years old. The second is in children between 10 and 14 years old.
Complications
Over time, type 1 diabetes complications can affect major organs in the body. These organs include the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes, and kidneys. Having a normal blood sugar level can lower the risk of many complications. Diabetes complications can lead to disabilities or even threaten your life.

Heart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes increases the risk of some problems with the heart and blood vessels. These include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), and high blood pressure.
Nerve damage (neuropathy). Too much sugar in the blood can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that feed the nerves. This is especially true in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning, or pain. This usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and spreads upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar could cause you to lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs over time.
Damage to the nerves that affect the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue.
Kidney damage (nephropathy). The kidneys have millions of tiny blood vessels that keep waste from entering the blood. Diabetes can damage this system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or end-stage kidney disease that can't be reversed. End-stage kidney disease needs to be treated with mechanical filtering of the kidneys (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.
Eye damage. Diabetes can damage the blood vessels in the retina (part of the eye that senses light) (diabetic retinopathy). This could cause blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.
Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of some foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections. These infections may need to be treated with toe, foot, or leg removal (amputation).
Skin and mouth conditions. Diabetes may leave you more prone to infections of the skin and mouth. These include bacterial and fungal infections. Gum disease and dry mouth also are more likely.
Pregnancy complications. High blood sugar levels can be dangerous for both the parent and the baby. The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and birth defects increases when diabetes isn't well-controlled. For the parent, diabetes increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic eye problems (retinopathy), pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, and preeclampsia.
Prevention
There's no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes. But researchers are working on preventing the disease or further damage of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed. Ask your provider if you might be eligible for one of these clinical trials. It is important to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of any treatment available in a trial.

Prediabetes
What is prediabetes?
Prediabetes means that your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. But if you make some lifestyle changes now, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.

What causes prediabetes?
Prediabetes usually happens when your body has a problem with insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. A problem with insulin could be:

Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use its insulin properly. It makes it hard for your cells to get glucose from your blood. This can cause your blood sugar levels to rise.
Your body can't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar levels at a healthy level.
Researchers think that being overweight and not getting regular physical activity are major factors in causing prediabetes.

Who is at risk for prediabetes?
About 1 out of every 3 adults has prediabetes. It is more common in people who:

Are overweight or have obesity
Are age 45 or older
Have a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes
Are African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American
Are not physically active
Have health conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol
Have had gestational diabetes (diabetes in pregnancy)
Have a history of heart disease or stroke
Have metabolic syndrome
Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
What are the symptoms of prediabetes?
Most people don't know they have prediabetes because usually there are no symptoms. Some people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpit or on the back and sides of the neck. They may also have many small skin growths in those same areas.

How is prediabetes diagnosed?
There are a few different blood tests that can diagnose prediabetes. The most common ones are:

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your blood sugar at a single point in time. You need to fast (not eat or drink) for at least 8 hours before the test. The results of the test are given in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter):
A normal level is 99 or below
Prediabetes is 100 to 125
Type 2 diabetes is 126 and above
A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar over the past 3 months. The results of an A1C test are given as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been.
A normal level is below 5.7%
Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%
Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5%
If I have prediabetes, will I get diabetes?
If you have prediabetes, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes:

Losing weight, if you are overweight
Getting regular physical activity
Following a healthy, reduced-calorie eating plan
In some cases, your health care provider may also recommend taking diabetes medicines.

Can prediabetes be prevented?
If you are at risk for prediabetes, those same lifestyle changes (losing weight, regular physical activity, and a healthy eating plan) may prevent you from getting it.

Insulin Resistance & Prediabetes
What is insulin?
Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps glucose in your blood enter cells in your muscle, fat, and liver, where it's used for energy. Glucose comes from the food you eat. The liver also makes glucose in times of need, such as when you're fasting. When blood glucose, also called blood sugar, levels rise after you eat, your pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin then lowers blood glucose to keep it in the normal range.

What is insulin resistance?
Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from your blood. As a result, your pancreas makes more insulin to help glucose enter your cells. As long as your pancreas can make enough insulin to overcome your cells' weak response to insulin, your blood glucose levels will stay in the healthy range.

What is prediabetes?
Prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Prediabetes usually occurs in people who already have some insulin resistance or whose beta cells in the pancreas aren’t making enough insulin to keep blood glucose in the normal range. Without enough insulin, extra glucose stays in your bloodstream rather than entering your cells. Over time, you could develop type 2 diabetes.

How common is prediabetes?
More than 84 million people ages 18 and older have prediabetes in the United States. That's about 1 out of every 3 adults.

Who is more likely to develop insulin resistance or prediabetes?
People who have genetic or lifestyle risk factors are more likely to develop insulin resistance or prediabetes. Risk factors include:

Overweight or obesity
Age 45 or older
A parent, brother, or sister with diabetes
African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American ethnicity
Physical inactivity
Health conditions such as high blood pressure and abnormal cholesterol levels
A history of gestational diabetes
A history of heart disease or stroke
Polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS
People who have metabolic syndrome—a combination of high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and large waist size—are more likely to have prediabetes. Along with these risk factors, other things that may contribute to insulin resistance include:

Certain medicines, such as glucocorticoids, some antipsychotics, and some medicines for HIV
Hormonal disorders, such as Cushing's syndrome and acromegaly
Sleep problems, especially sleep apnea
Although you can't change risk factors such as family history, age, or ethnicity, you can change lifestyle risk factors around eating, physical activity, and weight. These lifestyle changes can lower your chances of developing insulin resistance or prediabetes.

What causes insulin resistance and prediabetes?
Researchers don't fully understand what causes insulin resistance and prediabetes, but they think excess weight and lack of physical activity are major factors.

Excess weight
Experts believe obesity, especially too much fat in the abdomen and around the organs, called visceral fat, is a main cause of insulin resistance. A waist measurement of 40 inches or more for men and 35 inches or more for women is linked to insulin resistance. This is true even if your body mass index (BMI) falls within the normal range. However, research has shown that Asian Americans may have an increased risk for insulin resistance even without a high BMI. Researchers used to think that fat tissue was only for energy storage. However, studies have shown that belly fat makes hormones and other substances that can contribute to chronic, or long-lasting, inflammation in the body. Inflammation may play a role in insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Excess weight may lead to insulin resistance, which in turn may play a part in the development of fatty liver disease.

Physical inactivity
Not getting enough physical activity is linked to insulin resistance and prediabetes. Regular physical activity causes changes in your body that make it better able to keep your blood glucose levels in balance.

What are the symptoms of insulin resistance and prediabetes?
Most people don’t know they have insulin resistance or prediabetes until they develop problems from type 2 diabetes. However, some people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpit or on the back and sides of the neck, a condition called acanthosis nigricans. Many small skin growths often appear in these same areas. Even though blood glucose levels are not high enough to cause symptoms for most people, a few research studies have shown that some people with prediabetes may already have early changes in their eyes that can lead to retinopathy. This problem more often occurs in people with diabetes.

How do doctors diagnose insulin resistance and prediabetes?
Doctors use blood tests to find out if someone has prediabetes, but they don't usually test for insulin resistance. The most accurate test for insulin resistance is complicated and used mostly for research. Doctors most often use the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or the A1C test to diagnose prediabetes. Less often, doctors use the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is more expensive and not as easy to give.

The A1C test reflects your average blood glucose over the past 3 months. The FPG and OGTT show your blood glucose level at the time of the test. The A1C test is not as sensitive as the other tests. In some people, it may miss prediabetes that the OGTT could catch. The OGTT can identify how your body handles glucose after a meal—often before your fasting blood glucose level becomes abnormal. Often doctors use the OGTT to check for gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. People with prediabetes have up to a 50 percent chance of developing diabetes over the next 5 to 10 years. You can take steps to manage your prediabetes and prevent type 2 diabetes.

How can I prevent or reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes?
Physical activity and losing weight if you need to may help your body respond better to insulin. Taking small steps, such as eating healthier foods and moving more to lose weight, can help reverse insulin resistance and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes. The National Institutes of Health-funded research study, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), showed that for people at high risk of developing diabetes, losing 5 to 7 percent of their starting weight helped reduce their chance of developing the disease. That’s 10 to 14 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. People in the study lost weight by changing their diet and being more physically active.

Clinical Trials
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into various aspects of diabetes, including insulin resistance and prediabetes. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses. Find out if clinical trials are right for you at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Glycemic Index and Diabetes
What is Glycemic Index (GI)?
Glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a food can make your blood sugar (glucose) rise. Only foods that contain carbohydrates have a GI. Foods such as oils, fats, and meats do not have a GI, though in people with diabetes, they can affect the blood sugar. In general, low GI foods increase glucose slowly in your body. Foods with a high GI increase blood glucose quickly. If you have diabetes, high GI foods can make it harder to control diabetes.

Information
Not all carbohydrates work the same in the body. Some trigger a quick spike in blood sugar, while others work more slowly, avoiding large or rapid rises in blood sugar. The glycemic index addresses these differences by assigning a number to foods that reflects how quickly they increase blood glucose compared to pure glucose (sugar). The GI scale goes from 0 to 100. Pure glucose has the highest GI and is given a value of 100. Eating low GI foods can help you gain tighter control over your blood sugar. Paying attention to the GI of foods can be another tool to help manage diabetes, along with carbohydrate counting. Following a low-GI diet also may help with weight loss.

Glycemic Index of Certain Foods
Low GI foods (0 to 55):

Bulgur, barley
Pasta, parboiled (converted) rice
Quinoa
High-fiber bran cereal
Oatmeal, steel-cut or rolled
Carrots, non-starchy vegetables, greens
Apples, oranges, grapefruit, and many other fruits
Most nuts, legumes, and beans
Milk and yogurt
Moderate GI foods (56 to 69):

Pita bread, rye bread
Couscous
Brown rice
Raisins
High GI foods (70 and higher):

White bread and bagels
Most processed cereals and instant oatmeal, including bran flakes
Most snack foods
Potatoes
White rice
Honey
Sugar
Watermelon, pineapple
Meal Planning with the Glycemic Index
When planning your meals:

Choose foods that have a low to medium GI.
When eating a high GI food, combine it with low GI foods to balance the effect on your glucose levels. The GI of a food, and its impact on people with diabetes may change when you combine it with other foods.
The GI of a food is affected by certain factors, such as the ripeness of a piece of fruit. So, you need to think about more than the GI of a food when making healthy choices. When choosing meals, it's a good idea to keep these issues in mind:

Portion size still matters because calories still matter, and so does the amount of carbohydrates. You need to keep an eye on the portion size and number of carbohydrates in the meal you are having, even if it has low GI foods.
In general, processed foods have a higher GI. For example, fruit juice and instant potatoes have a higher GI than whole fruit and whole baked potatoes.
Cooking can affect the GI of a food. For example, al dente pasta has lower GI than soft-cooked pasta.
Foods higher in fat or fiber tend to have a lower GI.
Certain foods from the same class of foods can have different GI values. For example, converted long-grain white rice has a lower GI than brown rice. And short-grain white rice has a higher GI than brown rice. Likewise, quick oats or grits have a high GI but whole oats and whole-grain breakfast cereals have a lower GI.
Choose a variety of healthy foods keeping in mind the nutritional value of the whole meal as well as the GI of foods.
Some high GI foods are high in nutrients. So balance these with lower GI foods.
For many people with diabetes, carbohydrate counting, or carb counting, helps limit carbohydrates to a healthy amount. Carb counting along with choosing healthy foods and maintaining a healthy weight may be enough to control diabetes and lower the risk for complications. But if you have trouble controlling your blood sugar or want tighter control, you should talk with your health care provider about using the glycemic index as part of your action plan.

Summary:
Diabetes is a condition where the body does not make or use insulin properly, causing high blood glucose levels. There are two main types:

Type 1 Diabetes: The body doesn't produce insulin. Often discovered in children and teenagers.
Type 2 Diabetes: The body doesn't produce enough insulin or use it properly. Increasingly common in children due to obesity and lack of physical activity.
Prediabetes: Blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes but can be managed with lifestyle changes.
Symptoms of Diabetes:

Extreme hunger and thirst
Frequent urination
Unexplained weight loss
Fatigue
Blurry vision
Slow-healing wounds
Dry, itchy skin
Tingling or numbness in hands or feet
Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes:

Obesity
Age (especially over 45)
Family history
Gestational diabetes
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Smoking and alcohol use
Diagnosis:

Fasting blood sugar test
Oral glucose tolerance test
Random blood sugar test
A1C blood test
Prevention and Management:

Exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight.
Eat a healthy diet low in fat, cholesterol, salt, and sugar.
Stop smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.
Take medication as prescribed and monitor blood sugar levels.
Complications:

Diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage)
Diabetic retinopathy (eye damage)
Diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage)
Heart disease and stroke
Living with Diabetes:

Control blood sugar through diet, exercise, and medication.

Diabetes type 2 - meal planning
When you have type 2 diabetes, taking time to plan your meals goes a long way toward controlling your blood sugar and weight.

Function
Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has:

Food from all the food groups
Fewer calories
About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack
Healthy fats
Along with healthy eating, you can help keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. People with type 2 diabetes are often overweight or obese. Losing even 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 60 total minutes of walking or other activity per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. Activity lets your muscles use sugar from the blood without needing insulin to move the sugar into the muscle cells.

How Carbohydrates Affect Blood Sugar
Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.

The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. Not all carbohydrates can be broken down and absorbed by your body. Foods with more non-digestible carbohydrates, or fiber, are less likely to increase your blood sugar out of your goal range. These include foods such as beans and whole grains.

Meal Planning for Children with Type 2 Diabetes
Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be able to reach a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (150 minutes in a week).

Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition.

The following tips can help your child stay on track:

No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep blood sugar in target range.
Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control.
Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk.
Planning Meals
Everyone has individual needs. Work with your health care provider, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you.

When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices.

A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate).

Eat a Variety of Foods
Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal.

Vegetables (2 1/2 to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day)
Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro. Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable.

Fruits (1 1/2 to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day)
Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups.

Grains (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day)
There are 2 types of grains:

Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.
Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.
Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast.

Protein Foods (5 to 6 1/2 ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day)
Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil.

Dairy (3 cups or 245 grams a day)
Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label.

Oils/Fats (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day)
Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature.

Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter.

Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.

Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters).

What About Alcohol and Sweets?
If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you.

Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small.

Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:

Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.
Eat sweets that are sugar-free.
Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size.
Your Diabetes Care Team Is There to Help You
In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you.

Use a plate that is not too big. We recommend about 9 inches across. If your dinner plates are larger than this, try using a smaller salad or dessert plate. If your dinner plates have a lip or artwork inside the edge, use that as a border for filling your plate.
Divide Your Plate:

Imagine two lines drawn on your plate breaking it up into three sections.
Fill Half Your Plate with Non-Starchy Vegetables:

Non-starchy vegetables are lower in carbohydrates, so they do not raise blood sugar very much. They are also high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
Examples: asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, celery, cucumber, eggplant, leafy greens, mushrooms, okra, green beans, pea pods, snow peas, sugar snap peas, peppers, salad greens, squash, tomatoes.
Fill One Quarter of Your Plate with Lean Protein Foods:

Protein foods (especially those from animal sources) usually contain saturated fat, which may increase your risk of heart disease. Lean proteins are lower in fat and saturated fat, making them a healthier choice.
Examples: chicken, turkey, eggs, fish (like salmon, cod, tuna, tilapia, swordfish), shellfish (like shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, lobster), lean beef cuts, lean pork cuts, lean deli meats, cheese, cottage cheese, beans, lentils, hummus, falafel, nuts, nut butters, edamame, tofu, tempeh, plant-based meat substitutes.
Fill One Quarter of Your Plate with Carbohydrate Foods:

Foods higher in carbohydrates include grains, starchy vegetables, beans and legumes, fruit, yogurt, and milk. These foods have the greatest effect on blood sugar. Limiting your portion of carbohydrate foods to one quarter of your plate can help keep blood sugars from rising too high after meals.
Examples: whole grains (brown rice, bulgur, oats/oatmeal, polenta, popcorn, quinoa, whole grain products), starchy vegetables (acorn squash, butternut squash, green peas, parsnips, plantain, potato, pumpkin, sweet potato/yam), beans and legumes, fruits, dried fruit, dairy products like milk, yogurt, and milk substitutes.
Choose Water or a Low-Calorie Drink:

Water is the best choice because it contains no calories or carbohydrates and has no effect on blood sugar. Other options include unsweetened tea, unsweetened coffee, sparkling water/club soda, flavored water without added sugar, and diet soda or other diet drinks.
Tips for Combination Foods:
Our meals don't always fit neatly into the sections of the plate. Many dishes combine the different food types together, like soups, casseroles, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, etc.
You can still use the plate method when preparing and portioning combination foods. Identify the different foods in the dish and think about where they would fit on the plate. For example, in a slice of pizza, the crust would be the carbohydrate food, the cheese and any meats on top would be the protein foods, and the tomato sauce and any vegetables on top would be the non-starchy vegetables.
Try to prepare combination dishes with the same proportions as the plate method. For instance, build a pizza with a thin crust to reduce the portion of carbohydrates, and top it with lots of vegetables instead of meat (or choose a lean meat). Stick to just 1 or 2 slices and serve with a side salad so that half your meal is non-starchy vegetables.

Glycemic index and diabetes

Glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a food can make your blood sugar (glucose) rise. Only foods that contain carbohydrates have a GI. Foods such as oils, fats, and meats do not have a GI, though in people with diabetes, they can affect the blood sugar.

In general, low GI foods increase glucose slowly in your body. Foods with a high GI increase blood glucose quickly.

If you have diabetes, high GI foods can make it harder to control diabetes.

Information

Not all carbohydrates work the same in the body. Some trigger a quick spike in blood sugar, while others work more slowly, avoiding large or rapid rises in blood sugar. The glycemic index addresses these differences by assigning a number to foods that reflects how quickly they increase blood glucose compared to pure glucose (sugar).

The GI scale goes from 0 to 100. Pure glucose has the highest GI and is given a value of 100.

Eating low GI foods can help you gain tighter control over your blood sugar. Paying attention to the GI of foods can be another tool to help manage diabetes, along with carbohydrate counting. Following a low-GI diet also may help with weight loss.

Glycemic Index of Certain Foods

Low GI foods (0 to 55):

Bulgur, barley
Pasta, parboiled (converted) rice
Quinoa
High-fiber bran cereal
Oatmeal, steel-cut or rolled
Carrots, non-starchy vegetables, greens
Apples, oranges, grapefruit, and many other fruits
Most nuts, legumes, and beans
Milk and yogurt
Moderate GI foods (56 to 69):

Pita bread, rye bread
Couscous
Brown rice
Raisins
High GI foods (70 and higher):

White bread and bagels
Most processed cereals and instant oatmeal, including bran flakes
Most snack foods
Potatoes
White rice
Honey
Sugar
Watermelon, pineapple
Meal Planning with the Glycemic Index

When planning your meals:

Choose foods that have a low to medium GI.
When eating a high GI food, combine it with low GI foods to balance the effect on your glucose levels. The GI of a food, and its impact on people with diabetes, may change when you combine it with other foods.
The GI of a food is affected by certain factors, such as the ripeness of a piece of fruit. So, you need to think about more than the GI of a food when making healthy choices. When choosing meals, it's a good idea to keep these issues in mind.
Portion size still matters because calories still matter, and so does the amount of carbohydrates. You need to keep an eye on the portion size and number of carbohydrates in the meal you are having, even if it has low GI foods.
In general, processed foods have a higher GI. For example, fruit juice and instant potatoes have a higher GI than whole fruit and whole baked potatoes. Cooking can affect the GI of a food. For example, al dente pasta has lower GI than soft-cooked pasta.
Foods higher in fat or fiber tend to have a lower GI.
Certain foods from the same class of foods can have different GI values. For example, converted long-grain white rice has a lower GI than brown rice. And short-grain white rice has a higher GI than brown rice. Likewise, quick oats or grits have a high GI, but whole oats and whole-grain breakfast cereals have a lower GI.
Choose a variety of healthy foods, keeping in mind the nutritional value of the whole meal as well as the GI of foods. Some high GI foods are high in nutrients. So balance these with lower GI foods.
For many people with diabetes, carbohydrate counting, or carb counting, helps limit carbohydrates to a healthy amount. Carb counting along with choosing healthy foods and maintaining a healthy weight may be enough to control diabetes and lower the risk for complications. But if you have trouble controlling your blood sugar or want tighter control, you should talk with your health care provider about using the glycemic index as part of your action plan.

What is diabetes?

Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your body doesn’t make or use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone. It causes too much blood glucose (sugar) to build up in the blood. There are 2 main types of diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes occurs when your body doesn’t produce any insulin. It’s sometimes called juvenile diabetes because it’s usually discovered in children and teenagers, but it may appear in adults, too.
Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough insulin or doesn’t use the insulin as it should. In the past, doctors thought only adults were at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, an increasing number of children in the United States are now being diagnosed with the disease. Doctors think this increase is mostly because more children are overweight or have obesity and are less physically active.
Prediabetes occurs when blood sugar levels are higher than they should be, but not high enough to officially be diagnosed as diabetes. Prediabetes greatly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The good news is that, if you have prediabetes, you can prevent or delay the onset of full-blown type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly.
Symptoms of diabetes

Symptoms vary from person to person. The early stages of diabetes have very few symptoms. You may not know you have the disease. But damage may already be happening to your eyes, your kidneys, and your cardiovascular system. Common symptoms include:

Extreme hunger
Extreme thirst
Frequent urination
Unexplained weight loss
Fatigue or drowsiness
Blurry vision
Slow-healing wounds, sores, or bruises
Dry, itchy skin
Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet
Frequent or recurring skin, gum, bladder, or vaginal yeast infections
People who have type 2 diabetes also may show signs of insulin resistance. This includes darkening skin around the neck or in the armpits, high blood pressure, cholesterol problems, yeast infections, and skipped or absent periods in teen girls and women.

If blood sugars are extremely high, people can develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This is a very dangerous complication of uncontrolled diabetes. People with DKA might have:

Nausea or vomiting more than once
Deeper, faster breathing
The smell of nail polish remover coming from your breath
Weakness, drowsiness, trembling, confusion, or dizziness
Uncoordinated muscle movement
If diabetes is left untreated, your blood sugar levels become too high. When this happens, symptoms may include shortness of breath, pain in the abdomen, vomiting, dehydration, and even coma and death.

What causes diabetes?

Type 1:
In type 1 diabetes, your body doesn’t make insulin. This is because the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin. Doctors aren’t sure why this happens. You have a greater risk of type 1 diabetes if one of your parents or one of your siblings has it.

Type 2:
When you eat, your body changes most of the food you digest into glucose (a form of sugar). A hormone called insulin allows this glucose to enter all the cells of your body. There it is used for energy. Insulin is produced by the pancreas. In someone who has type 2 diabetes, the pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin or the body’s cells can’t use insulin properly (called insulin resistance). This causes glucose to build up in your blood instead of moving into the cells. Too much glucose in the blood can lead to serious health problems that damage the blood vessels, nerves, heart, eyes, and kidneys.

Certain risk factors for type 2 diabetes include:

Obesity is the single most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The more overweight you are, the more resistant your body is to insulin. To figure out if you’re overweight, talk to your doctor. A healthy, low-fat diet and regular exercise can help you lose weight gradually and keep it off.
The risk for type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after you’re 45 years old. Although you can’t change your age, you can work on other risk factors to reduce your risk.
Family history. You can’t change your family history, but it’s still important for you and your doctor to know if diabetes runs in your family. Your risk for diabetes is higher if your mother, father, or sibling has diabetes. Tell your doctor if anyone in your family has diabetes.
Gestational diabetes is a kind of diabetes that happens only during pregnancy. Although gestational diabetes goes away after pregnancy, about half of women who had gestational diabetes are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within 15 years. Even if they don’t have gestational diabetes, women who give birth to babies who weigh 9 pounds, or more are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends screening for gestational diabetes in pregnant women after the 24th week of pregnancy. The AAFP believes there is not enough evidence to determine the benefit and harm of screening for gestational diabetes in pregnant women before the 24th week of pregnancy.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This is a condition that occurs when an imbalance of hormone levels in a woman’s body causes cysts to form on the ovaries. Women who have PCOS are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Smoking and alcohol. Alcohol and tobacco use may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes. Stop smoking as soon as possible. It’s probably okay to drink some alcohol with a meal, but you should only have 1 serving each day. Less is even better. A serving is 4 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor.
The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with the number of risk factors you have. If you have 2 or more risk factors, talk to your doctor about how to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.

How is diabetes diagnosed?

After examining you, discussing your symptoms, and going over your health history, your doctor may test for diabetes if they suspect you’re at risk. To check for diabetes, your doctor may request the following tests:

Fasting blood sugar test. This test is usually done in the morning, after an 8-hour fast (not eating or drinking anything except water for 8 hours before the test). The blood test involves inserting a small needle into a vein in your arm to withdraw blood. That blood will be sent to a lab for testing. If your blood sugar level is 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher, your doctor will probably want to repeat the test. A blood sugar level of 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher on 2 occasions indicates diabetes. A blood sugar level of 100 mg per dL to 125 mg per dL suggest you have prediabetes. A blood sugar level of less than 99 mg per dL is normal.
Oral glucose tolerance test. During this test, you will drink a beverage containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This tastes like sweet water. Two hours later, a doctor or nurse will measure the amount of glucose in your blood. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes.
Random blood sugar test. This test measures the level of glucose in your blood at any time of day. It doesn’t matter when you last ate. Combined with symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes.
A1C blood test. This test provides information about a person’s average levels of blood glucose over the previous 3 months. The results are reported as a percentage. A normal A1C level is below 5.7%. If your A1C is higher than that, it means your blood sugar has been higher than normal during that three-month period. A test result between 5.7% and 6.4% indicates prediabetes. A result of 6.5% or above indicates diabetes.
The AAFP recommends screening adults for type 2 diabetes as part of a heart risk assessment for people between the ages of 40 and 70 years who are overweight or have obesity. Doctors are encouraged to offer or refer patients with abnormal blood glucose levels to behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity.

Can diabetes be prevented or avoided?

Talk to your doctor about your risk factors for diabetes. Although you may not be able to change all of them, you can make changes to significantly lower your risk.

Exercise and weight control. Exercising and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce your risk of diabetes. Any amount of activity is better than none. Try to exercise for 30 to 60 minutes most days of the week. Always talk with your doctor before starting an exercise program.

A diet high in fat, calories, and cholesterol increases your risk of diabetes. A poor diet can lead to obesity (another risk factor for diabetes) and other health problems. A healthy diet is high in fiber and low in fat, cholesterol, salt, and sugar. Also, remember to watch your portion size. How much you eat is just as important as what you eat.

Stop smoking. The science says it all. Smoking can increase your risk for diabetes. Stopping will help not only help your fight in diabetes but will reduce your risk of other chronic diseases as well, including cancer.

Reduce your alcohol. If you currently drink one drink a night, try to stretch it out to one drink every three days or even once a week.

Diabetes treatment

The single most important thing you can do is control your blood sugar level. You can do this by eating right, exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and, if needed, taking oral medicines or insulin.

Your diet should include lots of complex carbohydrates (such as whole grains), fruits, and vegetables. It’s important to eat at least 3 meals per day and never skip a meal. Eat at about the same time every day. This helps keep your insulin or medicine and sugar levels steady. Avoid empty calories, such as foods high in sugar and fat, or alcohol.

Exercising helps your body use insulin and lower your blood sugar level. It also helps control your weight, gives you more energy, and is good for your overall health. Exercise also is good for your heart, your cholesterol levels, your blood pressure, and your weight. These are all factors that can affect your risk of heart attack and stroke. Talk with your doctor about starting an exercise program.

Maintain a healthy weight. Losing excess weight and maintaining a healthy body weight will help you in 2 ways. First, it helps insulin work better in your body. Second, it will lower your blood pressure and decrease your risk for heart disease. Even a 10% reduction in weight can lower your blood sugar levels.

Take your medicine. If your diabetes can’t be controlled with diet, exercise, and weight control, your doctor may recommend medicine or insulin. Most people who have type 2 diabetes start with an oral medicine (taken by mouth). The most common oral medicine is Metformin. Your doctor will determine your dose after looking at your A1C. Some people experience short or long-term stomach upset and diarrhea with Metformin. If it’s bad enough, talk to your doctor about another oral medicine. There are other oral medicines that can make your body produce more insulin. They also help your body use the insulin it makes more efficiently. Some people need to add insulin to their bodies with insulin injections, insulin pens, or insulin pumps. Always take medicines exactly as your doctor prescribes. Some oral medicines don’t work for everyone. And some have other side effects, including weight gain. It isn’t effective in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Insulin therapy is necessary for all people who have type 1 diabetes and for some people who have type 2 diabetes. If you need insulin, you’ll have to give yourself a shot (either with a syringe or with an insulin pen). Your doctor will tell you which kind of medicine you should take and why. The newest prescription medicines for type 2 diabetes come in the form of “injectables.” These include brand names such as Ozempic and Mounjaro. The benefits of these medicines include not having to take medicine daily and weight loss. The most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. Another injectable, known by the brand name Wegovy is not FDA approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. But some prescribe it for weight loss, which can contribute to a reduction in blood sugar.

Your doctor will test your blood sugar every 3 months with an A1C test. Your doctor may ask you to test your blood sugar on your own throughout the day if you are taking insulin or they are adjusting your medication. You will need to use a blood glucose monitor to check it on your own. This involves pricking your finger for blood and putting a test strip in the blood. Putting the test strip in the monitor gets the results. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are also an option to help people with diabetes measure their blood glucose around the clock.

If your blood sugar gets too low, you might feel tired, experience problems with muscle coordination, sweat, have difficulty thinking or speaking clearly, twitch, feel like you’re going to faint, become pale, lose consciousness, or have a seizure. At the earliest sign of any of these symptoms, eat or drink something that will raise your blood sugar fast. This could include candy, juice, milk, or raisins. If you don’t feel better in 15 minutes or if monitoring shows that your blood sugar level is still too low, eat or drink another item to raise your blood sugar fast. Always keep a supply of these items on hand for emergencies.

You may not know if your blood sugar is too high unless you test it yourself. However, you may experience common symptoms such as frequent urination, extreme thirst, blurry vision, and feeling tired. Some factors unrelated to food can make your blood sugar high. This includes not taking your insulin correctly, overeating at a meal, illness, having hormonal changes, and stress.

If your blood sugar level is too high and you take insulin, you may need to take an extra dose of rapid- or short-acting insulin to return to normal. Your doctor can tell you how much insulin you need to take to lower your blood sugar level.

Living with diabetes

You can live a normal life with well-controlled diabetes. However, you must pay close and regular attention to your diet, weight, exercise, and medicine. If you don’t control your diabetes, you will have too much glucose in your blood. This can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and damage to the nerves and kidneys. These are known as diabetic complications. Complications include:

Diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). This makes it hard for your nerves to send messages to your brain and other parts of the body. You may lose feeling in parts of your body or have a painful, tingling, or burning feeling. Neuropathy most often affects the feet and legs. If you have neuropathy, you may not be able to feel a sore on your foot. The sore can become infected. In serious cases, the foot may have to be amputated (removed). People who have neuropathy may continue walking on a foot that has damaged joints or bones. This can lead to a condition called Charcot foot. Charcot foot causes swelling and instability in the injured foot. It can also cause the foot to become deformed. However, this problem can often be avoided. Check your feet every day. See your doctor immediately if you see swelling, redness, and feel warmth in your foot. These can be signs of Charcot foot. Your doctor should check your feet frequently, too. Neuropathy also can cause erectile dysfunction in men and vaginal dryness in women.
Diabetic retinopathy (eye problems). This affects the part of your eye called the retina. It’s the part of the eye that is sensitive to light and sends messages to your brain about what you see. Diabetes can damage and weaken the small blood vessels in the retina. When the blood vessels of your retina are damaged, fluid can leak from them and cause swelling in your macula. The macula is the part of the retina that gives you sharp, clear vision. Swelling and fluid can cause blurry vision. This makes it hard for you to see. If retinopathy gets worse, it may lead to blindness. Laser surgery can often be used to treat or slow down retinopathy if found early. People who have diabetes should have an eye exam once a year. See your doctor if you have blurry vision for more than 2 days, sudden loss of vision in 1 or both eyes, black or moving gray spots often called “floaters,” flashing lights, or pain or pressure in your eyes.
Diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage). This is damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. This means your kidneys have trouble filtering out waste. Some people who have nephropathy will eventually need dialysis (a machine treatment that eliminates waste from the blood) or a kidney transplant. The risk for nephropathy is increased if you have both diabetes and high blood pressure, so it’s important to control both conditions. Protein in the urine is usually the first sign of nephropathy. This should be checked yearly.
Heart disease and stroke. People who have diabetes are at greater risk for heart disease and stroke. The risk is even greater for people who have diabetes and smoke, have high blood pressure, have a family history of heart disease, or are overweight. Heart disease is easiest to treat when it’s caught early. It’s very important to see your doctor on a regular basis. They can test for early signs of heart disease. This includes checking cholesterol levels. If your cholesterol is higher than the recommended level, your doctor will talk to you about lifestyle changes and medicine to help get your cholesterol under control.
The longer your diabetes is uncontrolled, the more damage you do to your health. That’s why treatment is important at any age. Keeping blood sugar levels very close to the ideal can minimize, delay, and in some cases even prevent the problems that diabetes can cause.

Questions to ask your doctor

How did I get diabetes?
If I have diabetes, will my children develop it, too?
Will I need to take insulin?
If I don’t have a family history of diabetes, can I still get it?
Can your diabetes get worse even if you do everything right?
Can I prevent gestational diabetes?
If I had gestational diabetes while pregnant, will I get type 2 diabetes later? Will the babies of a mom with gestational diabetes develop diabetes?
How can I tell the difference between Charcot foot and gout in my foot?

What is diabetes?
If you have diabetes [https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html], your blood glucose [https://medlineplus.gov/bloodglucose.html], or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.

With type 1 diabetes [https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype1.html], your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes [https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html], your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.

Prediabetes [https://medlineplus.gov/prediabetes.html] means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.

How do the foods I eat affect my blood glucose levels?

The glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates [https://medlineplus.gov/carbohydrates.html], or "carbs." Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be.

Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood glucose at a level that is healthy for you. When you control your blood glucose, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes [https://medlineplus.gov/diabetescomplications.html], such as vision loss [https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticeyeproblems.html] and heart problems [https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticheartdisease.html].

And if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood glucose levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes [https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventdiabetes.html] later on.

What's the best diet for diabetes?

There isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator who can help design the best eating plan for you. The plan will consider:

Any medicines that you take
Your weight goals
All eating plans for diabetes have a few things in common, including eating the right foods in the right amounts at the right times.

What foods should I eat if I have diabetes?

Eating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups:

Fruits and vegetables
Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats
Proteins [https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryproteins.html], such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu
Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese
What foods should I limit to control my blood glucose?

To keep your blood glucose under control, you may need to cut back on certain foods and drinks. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you will need to have them less often or in smaller amounts.

High-carb foods and drinks, such as:
Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar
Drinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks
White rice, tortillas, breads and pasta - especially those made with white flour
Starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas
Fried foods and other foods high in saturated trans fats [https://medlineplus.gov/dietaryfats.html].
Foods high in sodium [https://medlineplus.gov/sodium.html] (salt).
Alcohol. If you do drink, you should drink moderately. This means no more than one standard drink a day if you're a woman or two standard drinks a day if you're a man.
What else do I need to know about diabetic diets?

If you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, so that you get the right amount of carbs in each meal or snack. You'll learn how to count carbs and measure your food.

Eating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid blood glucose levels that are too high or too low for you. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful.

Your eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out.

Eating healthy to control your blood glucose does take some effort. But the reward is a chance to live your healthiest life with diabetes.

Symptoms & Causes of Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, and several factors contribute to its development, including lifestyle and genetics. Overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Extra belly fat is specifically linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

Causes of Type 2 Diabetes:

Insulin Resistance: Type 2 diabetes often starts with insulin resistance where muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin well. Initially, the pancreas compensates by producing more insulin, but over time it can't keep up, causing blood glucose levels to rise.
Genes and Family History: Certain genes may predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes, and the disease is more common in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. Genes can also increase the risk by influencing body weight.
Causes of Gestational Diabetes:

Insulin Resistance: Hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause insulin resistance. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance, but some cannot. Overweight women or those who gain too much weight during pregnancy are at higher risk.
Genes and Family History: Genetic factors and family history can increase the likelihood of developing gestational diabetes.
Other Causes of Diabetes:

Genetic Mutations: Monogenic diabetes, such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), is caused by mutations in a single gene.
Cystic Fibrosis: Causes thick mucus that can scar the pancreas, leading to insufficient insulin production.
Hemochromatosis: Leads to excess iron storage, damaging the pancreas and other organs.
Hormonal Diseases: Conditions like Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, and hyperthyroidism can cause insulin resistance and diabetes.
Damage to the Pancreas: Pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can harm beta cells, resulting in diabetes.
Medicines: Certain medications, such as niacin, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, HIV drugs, and glucocorticoids, can disrupt insulin function or damage beta cells.

Diabetes Risk Factors

In the U.S., about 97.6 million adults age 18-64 and 27.2 million adults age 65 or older have prediabetes, and many people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are unaware of their condition. Some diabetes risk factors can be controlled by lifestyle choices. These are called modifiable risk factors. Those that you can't change are non-modifiable risk factors.

Non-Modifiable Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes:

Family History: The risk of diabetes is increased if your parents or siblings have the disease. Share your family health history with your health care professional to find out what it may mean for you.
Race/Ethnicity: If you are a Black American, Asian American, Latino/Hispanic American, Native American, or of Pacific-Islander, you have a greater chance of developing diabetes.
Age: The older you are, the higher your risk for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes generally occurs in middle-aged adults, most frequently after age 45. But health care professionals are diagnosing more and more children and adolescents with Type 2 diabetes.
Gestational Diabetes: If you developed diabetes during pregnancy, you are at increased risk of developing diabetes again later in life.
Modifiable Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes:

Weight Management: Being overweight or obese increases risk. Maintaining a healthy weight can lower it.
Physical Activity: Regular physical activity helps lower insulin resistance. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities.
Blood Pressure: Managing high blood pressure is crucial as it can complicate diabetes.
Smoking: Quitting smoking reduces the risk of diabetes and improves overall health.
Living with Diabetes:

Healthy Lifestyle Choices: Proactive management of modifiable risk factors can prevent or delay diabetes and improve quality of life.
Resources: Tools and resources for managing diabetes and reducing cardiovascular disease risk are available at KnowDiabetesbyHeart.org.

Why a meal plan is important
A meal plan is your guide for when, what, and how much to eat. Your plan will help make sure you get the nutrition you need while keeping your blood sugar levels on target. A good meal plan will consider your goals, tastes, and lifestyle, as well as any medicines you take.

A good meal plan will also:

Include more nonstarchy vegetables, such as broccoli, spinach, and green beans.
Include fewer added sugars and refined grains, such as white bread, rice, and pasta.
Focus on whole foods instead of highly processed foods as much as possible.
Carbohydrates in the food you eat raise your blood sugar levels. How fast carbs raise your blood sugar depends on what the food is and what you eat with it. For example, drinking fruit juice raises blood sugar faster than eating whole fruit. Eating carbs with foods that have protein, fat, or fiber slows down how quickly your blood sugar rises.

Tips
Counting carbs
Keeping track of and limiting how many carbs you eat at each meal can help manage your blood sugar levels. Work with your doctor or a registered dietitian to find out how many carbs you should aim for. Then refer to this list of common foods that contain carbs and serving sizes.

The plate method
It's easy to eat more food than you need without realizing it. Try the plate method to balance the amounts of vegetables, lean protein, and carb foods in your meal.

Start with a 9-inch dinner plate (about the length of a business envelope):

Fill half with nonstarchy veggies, such as salad, green beans, and broccoli.
Fill one quarter with a lean protein, such as chicken, beans, tofu, or eggs.
Fill one quarter with carb foods.
Foods higher in carbs include grains, starchy vegetables (such as potatoes and peas), rice, pasta, beans, fruit, and yogurt. A cup of milk also counts as a carb food. Then choose water or a low-calorie drink such as unsweetened iced tea to go with your meal.

About portion size
Portion size and serving size aren't always the same. A portion is the amount of food you choose to eat at one time. A serving is a specific amount of food, such as one slice of bread or 8 ounces (1 cup) of milk.

These days, portions at restaurants are quite a bit larger than they were several years ago. One entrée can equal 3 or 4 servings! Studies show that people tend to eat more when they're served more food. Getting portions under control is really important for managing weight and blood sugar.

If you're eating out, ask for half of your meal to be wrapped up to go so you can enjoy it later. At home, measure out snacks; don't eat straight from the bag or box. At dinnertime, reduce the temptation to go back for seconds by keeping the serving bowls out of reach. And with this "handy" guide, you'll always have a way to estimate portion size at your fingertips:

3 ounces of meat, fish, or poultry: palm of hand (no fingers)
1 ounce of cheese or meat: thumb (tip to base)
1 cup or 1 medium fruit: fist
1-2 ounces of nuts or pretzels: cupped hand
1 tablespoon: thumb tip (tip to 1st joint)
1 teaspoon: fingertip (tip to 1st joint)
Use the handy method to estimate portion sizes on the go.

Diabetes type 2 - meal planning
When you have type 2 diabetes, taking time to plan your meals goes a long way toward controlling your blood sugar and weight.

Function
Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has:

Food from all the food groups
Fewer calories
About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack
Healthy fats
Along with healthy eating, you can help keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. People with type 2 diabetes are often overweight or obese. Losing even 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 60 total minutes of walking or other activity per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. Activity lets your muscles use sugar from the blood without needing insulin to move the sugar into the muscle cells.

How Carbohydrates Affect Blood Sugar
Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.

The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. Not all carbohydrates can be broken down and absorbed by your body. Foods with more non-digestible carbohydrates, or fiber, are less likely to increase your blood sugar out of your goal range. These include foods such as beans and whole grains.

Meal Planning for Children with Type 2 Diabetes
Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be able to reach a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (150 minutes in a week).

Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition.

The following tips can help your child stay on track:

No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep blood sugar in target range.
Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control.
Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk.
Planning Meals
Everyone has individual needs. Work with your health care provider, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you.

When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices.

A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate).

Eat a Variety of Foods
Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal.

Vegetables (2 1/2 to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day)
Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro. Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable.

Fruits (1 1/2 to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day)
Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups.

Grains (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day)
There are 2 types of grains:

Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.
Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.
Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast.

Protein Foods (5 to 6 1/2 ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day)
Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil.

Dairy (3 cups or 245 grams a day)
Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label.

Oils/Fats (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day)
Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature.

Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter.

Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.

Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters).

What About Alcohol and Sweets?
If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you.

Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small.

Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:

Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.
Eat sweets that are sugar-free.
Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size.
Your Diabetes Care Team Is There to Help You
In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you.

Chapter-5: Diabetes: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments by B. Suresh Lal
Summary:

Diabetes, often referred to by doctors as diabetes mellitus, describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body’s cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both. Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia).

The meaning and origin of diabetes mellitus: Diabetes comes from Greek, and it means a “siphon”. Aretus the Cappadocian, a Greek physician during the second century A.D., named the condition diabainein. He described patients who were passing too much water (polyuria) - like a siphon. The word became “diabetes” from the English adoption of the Medieval Latin diabetes. In 1675, Thomas Willis added mellitus to the term, although it is commonly referred to simply as diabetes. Mel in Latin means “honey”; the urine and blood of people with diabetes has excess glucose, and glucose is sweet like honey. Diabetes mellitus could literally mean “siphoning off sweet water”. In ancient China people observed that ants would be attracted to some people’s urine, because it was sweet. The term “Sweet Urine Disease” was coined.

Some Key Aspects of Diabetes:

Diabetes is a long-term condition that causes high blood sugar levels.
In 2013 it was estimated that over 382 million people throughout the world had diabetes.
Type 1 Diabetes: The body does not produce insulin. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.
Type 2 Diabetes: The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function. Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are of this type.
Gestational Diabetes: This type affects females during pregnancy.
The most common diabetes symptoms include frequent urination, intense thirst and hunger, weight gain, unusual weight loss, fatigue, cuts and bruises that do not heal, male sexual dysfunction, numbness and tingling in hands and feet.
If you have Type 1 and follow a healthy eating plan, do adequate exercise, and take insulin, you can lead a normal life.
Type 2 patients need to eat healthily, be physically active, and test their blood glucose. They may also need to take oral medication, and/or insulin to control blood glucose levels.
Types of Diabetes:

Type 1 Diabetes: The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years. Type 1 diabetes is nowhere near as common as type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1. Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.

Type 2 Diabetes: The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance). Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2. Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up having to take insulin, usually in tablet form. Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body’s cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

Gestational Diabetes: This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made during pregnancy. The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. Between 10 to 20 percent of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications. Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth.

What is Prediabetes:
The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes initially had prediabetes. Their blood glucose levels were higher than normal, but not high enough to merit a diabetes diagnosis. The cells in the body are becoming resistant to insulin.

Diabetes is a Metabolism Disorder:
Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is classed as a metabolism disorder. Metabolism refers to the way our bodies use digested food for energy and growth. Most of what we eat is broken down into glucose. Glucose is a form of sugar in the blood - it is the principal source of fuel for our bodies. When our food is digested, the glucose makes its way into our bloodstream. Our cells use the glucose for energy and growth. However, glucose cannot enter our cells without insulin being present - insulin makes it possible for our cells to take in the glucose. Insulin is a hormone that is produced by the pancreas. After eating, the pancreas automatically releases an adequate quantity of insulin to move the glucose present in our blood into the cells, as soon as glucose enters the cells blood-glucose levels drop. A person with diabetes has a condition in which the quantity of glucose in the blood is too elevated (hyperglycemia). This is because the body does not produce enough insulin, produces no insulin, or has cells that do not respond properly to the insulin the pancreas produces. This results in too much glucose building up in the blood. This excess blood glucose eventually passes out of the body in urine. So, even though the blood has plenty of glucose, the cells are not getting it for their essential energy and growth requirements.

How to Determine Whether You Have Diabetes, Prediabetes or Neither:
Doctors can determine whether a patient has a normal metabolism, prediabetes or diabetes in one of three different ways (tests):

The A1C test: At least 6.5% means diabetes; between 5.7% and 5.99% means prediabetes; less than 5.7% means normal.
The FPG (fasting plasma glucose) test: At least 126 mg/dl means diabetes; between 100 mg/dl and 125.99 mg/dl means prediabetes; less than 100 mg/dl means normal.
The OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test): At least 200 mg/dl means diabetes; between 140 and 199.9 mg/dl means prediabetes; less than 140 mg/dl means normal.
An abnormal reading following the FPG means the patient has impaired fasting glucose (IFG). An abnormal reading following the OGTT means the patient has impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Treatment:
All types of diabetes are treatable. Diabetes type 1 lasts a lifetime, there is no known cure. Type 2 usually lasts a lifetime, however, some people have managed to get rid of their symptoms without medication, through a combination of yoga, exercise, diet and body weight control. Patients with type 1 are treated with regular insulin injections, as well as a special diet, yoga and exercise. Patients with Type 2 diabetes are usually treated with tablets, exercise and a special diet, but sometimes insulin injections are also required. If diabetes is not adequately controlled the patient has a significantly higher risk of developing complications.

Complications Linked to Badly Controlled Diabetes:
Below is a list of possible complications that can be caused by badly controlled diabetes:

Eye complications: Glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and some others.
Foot complications: Neuropathy, ulcers, and sometimes gangrene which may require that the foot be amputated.
Skin complications: People with diabetes are more susceptible to skin infections and skin disorders.
Heart problems: Such as ischemic heart disease, when the blood supply to the heart muscle is diminished.
Hypertension: Common in people with diabetes, which can raise the risk of kidney disease, eye problems, heart attack and stroke.
Mental health: Uncontrolled diabetes raises the risk of suffering from depression, anxiety and some other mental disorders.
Hearing loss: Diabetes patients have a higher risk of developing hearing problems.
Gum disease: There is a much higher prevalence of gum disease among diabetes patients.
Gastroparesis: The muscles of the stomach stop working properly.
Ketoacidosis: A combination of ketosis and acidosis; accumulation of ketone bodies and acidity in the blood.
Neuropathy: Diabetic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage which can lead to several different problems.
HHNS (Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome): Blood glucose levels shoot up too high, and there are no ketones present in the blood or urine. It is an emergency condition.
Nephropathy: Uncontrolled blood pressure can lead to kidney disease.
PAD (peripheral arterial disease): Symptoms may include pain in the leg, tingling and sometimes problems walking properly.
Stroke: If blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood glucose levels are not controlled, the risk of stroke increases significantly.
Erectile dysfunction: Male impotence.
Infections: People with badly controlled diabetes are much more susceptible to infections.
Healing of wounds: Cuts and lesions take much longer to heal.
Some Facts and Myths about Diabetes:
Many presumed “facts” are thrown about in the paper press, magazines and on the internet regarding diabetes; some of them are, in fact, myths. It is important that people with diabetes, pre diabetes, their loved ones, employers and schools have an accurate picture of the disease. Below are some diabetes myths:

People with diabetes should not exercise - NOT TRUE!! Exercise is important for people with diabetes, as it is for everybody else. Exercise helps manage body weight, improves cardiovascular health, improves mood, helps blood sugar control, and relieves stress. Patients should discuss exercise with their doctor first.
Fat people always develop type 2 diabetes eventually - this is not true. Being overweight or obese raises the risk of becoming diabetic, they are risk factors, but do not mean that an obese person will definitely become diabetic. Many people with type 2 diabetes were never overweight. The majority of overweight people do not develop type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes is a nuisance, but not serious - two thirds of diabetes patients die prematurely from stroke or heart disease. The life expectancy of a person with diabetes is from five to ten years shorter than other people’s. Diabetes is a serious disease.
Children can outgrow diabetes - this is not true. Nearly all children with diabetes have type 1; insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas have been destroyed. These never come back. Children with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin for the rest of their lives, unless a cure is found one day.
Don’t eat too much sugar, you will become diabetic - this is not true. A person with diabetes type 1 developed the disease because their immune system destroyed the insulin-producing beta cells. A diet high in calories, which can make people overweight/obese, raises the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, especially if there is a history of this disease in the family.
I know when my blood sugar levels are high or low - very high or low blood sugar levels may cause some symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue and extreme thirst. However, levels need to be fluctuating a lot for symptoms to be felt. The only way to be sure about your blood sugar levels is to test them regularly. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark showed that even very slight rises in blood-glucose levels significantly raise the risk of ischemic heart disease.
Diabetes diets are different from other people’s - the diet doctors and specialized nutritionists recommend for diabetes patients are healthy ones; healthy for everybody, including people without the disease. Meals should contain plenty of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and they should be low in salt and sugar, and saturated or trans fat. Experts say that there is no need to buy special diabetic foods because they offer no special benefit, compared to the healthy things we can buy in most shops.
High blood sugar levels are fine for some, while for others they are a sign of diabetes - high blood sugar levels are never normal for anybody. Some illnesses, mental stress and steroids can cause temporary hikes in blood sugar levels in people without diabetes. Anybody with higher-than normal blood sugar levels or sugar in their urine should be checked for diabetes by a health care professional.
Diabetics cannot eat bread, potatoes or pasta - people with diabetes can eat starchy foods. However, they must keep an eye on the size of the portions. Whole grain starchy foods are better, as is the case for people without diabetes.
One person can transmit diabetes to another person - NOT TRUE. Just like a broken leg is not infectious or contagious. A parent may pass on, through their genes to their offspring, a higher susceptibility to developing the disease.
Only older people develop type 2 diabetes - things are changing. A growing number of children and teenagers are developing type 2 diabetes. Experts say that this is linked to the explosion in childhood obesity rates, poor diet, and physical inactivity.
I have to go on insulin, this must mean my diabetes is severe - people take insulin when diet alone or diet with oral or non-insulin injectable diabetes drugs do not provide good-enough diabetes control, that’s all. Insulin helps diabetes control. It does not usually have anything to do with the severity of the disease.
If you have diabetes you cannot eat chocolates or sweets - people with diabetes can eat chocolates and sweets if they combine them with exercise or eat them as part of a healthy meal.
Diabetes patients are more susceptible to colds and illnesses in general - a person with diabetes with good diabetes control is no more likely to become ill with a cold or something else than other people. However, when a diabetic catches a cold, their diabetes becomes harder to control, so they have a higher risk of complications.
Symptoms of Diabetes:
People can often have diabetes and be completely unaware. The main reason for this is that the symptoms, when seen on their own, seem harmless. However, the earlier diabetes is diagnosed the greater the chances are that serious complications, which can result from having diabetes, can be avoided.

Here is a list of the most common diabetes symptoms:

Frequent urination: Have you been going to the bathroom to urinate more often recently? Do you notice that you spend most of the day going to the toilet? When there is too much glucose (sugar) in your blood you will urinate more often. If your insulin is ineffective, or not there at all, your kidneys cannot filter the glucose back into the blood. The kidneys will take water from your blood in order to dilute the glucose - which in turn fills up your bladder.
Disproportionate thirst: If you are urinating more than usual, you will need to replace that lost liquid. You will be drinking more than usual. Have you been drinking more than usual lately?
Intense hunger: As the insulin in your blood is not working properly, or is not there at all, and your cells are not getting their energy, your body may react by trying to find more energy - food. You will become hungry.
Weight gain: This might be the result of the above symptom (intense hunger).
Unusual weight loss: This is more common among people with Diabetes Type 1. As your body is not making insulin it will seek out another energy source (the cells aren’t getting glucose). Muscle tissue and fat will be broken down for energy. As Type 1 is of a more sudden onset and Type 2 is much more gradual, weight loss is more noticeable with Type 1.
Increased fatigue: If your insulin is not working properly, or is not there at all, glucose will not be entering your cells and providing them with energy. This will make you feel tired and listless.
Irritability: Irritability can be due to your lack of energy.
Blurred vision: This can be caused by tissue being pulled from your eye lenses. This affects your eyes’ ability to focus. With proper treatment this can be treated. There are severe cases where blindness or prolonged vision problems can occur.
Cuts and bruises don’t heal properly or quickly: Do you find cuts and bruises take a much longer time than usual to heal? When there is more sugar (glucose) in your body, its ability to heal can be undermined.
More skin and/or yeast infections: When there is more sugar in your body, its ability to recover from infections is affected. Women with diabetes find it especially difficult to recover from bladder and vaginal infections.
Itchy skin: A feeling of itchiness on your skin is sometimes a symptom of diabetes.
Gums are red and/or swollen - Gums pull away from teeth: If your gums are tender, red and/or swollen this could be a sign of diabetes. Your teeth could become loose as the gums pull away from them.
Frequent gum disease/infection: As well as the previous gum symptoms, you may experience more frequent gum disease and/or gum infections.
Sexual dysfunction among men: If you are over 50 and experience frequent or constant sexual dysfunction (erectile dysfunction), it could be a symptom of diabetes.
Numbness or tingling, especially in your feet and hands: If there is too much sugar in your body your nerves could become damaged, as could the tiny blood vessels that feed those nerves. You may experience tingling and/or numbness in your hands and feet.
Diagnosis of Diabetes:
Diabetes can often be detected by carrying out a urine test, which finds out whether excess glucose is present. This is normally backed up by a blood test, which measures blood glucose levels and can confirm if the cause of your symptoms is diabetes. If you are worried that you may have some of the above symptoms, you are recommended to talk to your Doctor or a qualified health professional.

What else can cause diabetes?
What are the symptoms of diabetes?
Symptoms of diabetes include:

Increased thirst and urination
Increased hunger
Fatigue
Blurred vision
Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands
Sores that do not heal
Unexplained weight loss
Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly—over the course of several years—and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or heart trouble.

What causes type 1 diabetes?
Type 1 diabetes occurs when your immune system, the body's system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as TrialNet are working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.

What causes type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes—the most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.

Overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity:
You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you are not physically active and are overweight or obese. Extra weight sometimes causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and heart and blood vessel disease. To see if your weight puts you at risk for type 2 diabetes, check out these Body Mass Index (BMI) charts.

Insulin resistance:
Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance—a condition in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.

Genes and family history:
As in type 1 diabetes, certain genes may make you more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. The disease tends to run in families and occurs more often in these racial/ethnic groups:

African Americans
Alaska Natives
American Indians
Asian Americans
Hispanics/Latinos
Native Hawaiians
Pacific Islanders
Genes also can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing a person’s tendency to become overweight or obese.

What causes gestational diabetes?
Scientists believe gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.

Insulin resistance:
Hormones produced by the placenta contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. Gestational diabetes occurs when the pancreas can’t make enough insulin.

Genes and family history:
Having a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role. Genes also may explain why the disorder occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinas, and Pacific Islanders. Genes may also explain why it occurs more often among overweight women during pregnancy. Being overweight is linked to gestational diabetes.

What else can cause diabetes?
Genetic mutations, other diseases, damage to the pancreas, and certain medicines may also cause diabetes.

Genetic mutations:

Monogenic diabetes is caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These changes are usually passed through families, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs on its own. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by making the pancreas less able to make insulin. Examples of monogenic diabetes include neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
Cystic fibrosis produces thick mucus that causes scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.
Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disease is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.
Hormonal diseases:
Some hormonal diseases cause the body to produce too much of certain hormones, which sometimes cause insulin resistance and diabetes. Cushing’s syndrome occurs when the body produces too much cortisol—often called the “stress hormone.” Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.

Damage to or removal of the pancreas:
Pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can all harm the beta cells or make them less able to produce insulin, resulting in diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.

Medicines:
Sometimes certain medicines can harm beta cells or disrupt the way insulin works. These include:

Niacin, a type of vitamin B3
Certain types of diuretics, also called water pills
Anti-seizure drugs
Psychiatric drugs
Drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Pentamidine, a drug used to treat a type of pneumonia
Glucocorticoids—medicines used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis
Anti-rejection medicines, used to help stop the body from rejecting a transplanted organ

Symptoms & Causes of Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, and several factors contribute to its development, including lifestyle and genetics. Overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Extra belly fat is specifically linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

Causes of Type 2 Diabetes:

Insulin Resistance: Type 2 diabetes often starts with insulin resistance where muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin well. Initially, the pancreas compensates by producing more insulin, but over time it can't keep up, causing blood glucose levels to rise.
Genes and Family History: Certain genes may predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes, and the disease is more common in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. Genes can also increase the risk by influencing body weight.
Causes of Gestational Diabetes:

Insulin Resistance: Hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause insulin resistance. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance, but some cannot. Overweight women or those who gain too much weight during pregnancy are at higher risk.
Genes and Family History: Genetic factors and family history can increase the likelihood of developing gestational diabetes.
Other Causes of Diabetes:

Genetic Mutations: Monogenic diabetes, such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), is caused by mutations in a single gene.
Cystic Fibrosis: Causes thick mucus that can scar the pancreas, leading to insufficient insulin production.
Hemochromatosis: Leads to excess iron storage, damaging the pancreas and other organs.
Hormonal Diseases: Conditions like Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, and hyperthyroidism can cause insulin resistance and diabetes.
Damage to the Pancreas: Pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and trauma can harm beta cells, resulting in diabetes.
Medicines: Certain medications, such as niacin, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, HIV drugs, and glucocorticoids, can disrupt insulin function or damage beta cells.

Diabetes Risk Factors

In the U.S., about 97.6 million adults age 18-64 and 27.2 million adults age 65 or older have prediabetes, and many people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are unaware of their condition. Some diabetes risk factors can be controlled by lifestyle choices. These are called modifiable risk factors. Those that you can't change are non-modifiable risk factors.

Non-Modifiable Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes:

Family History: The risk of diabetes is increased if your parents or siblings have the disease. Share your family health history with your health care professional to find out what it may mean for you.
Race/Ethnicity: If you are a Black American, Asian American, Latino/Hispanic American, Native American, or of Pacific-Islander, you have a greater chance of developing diabetes.
Age: The older you are, the higher your risk for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes generally occurs in middle-aged adults, most frequently after age 45. But health care professionals are diagnosing more and more children and adolescents with Type 2 diabetes.
Gestational Diabetes: If you developed diabetes during pregnancy, you are at increased risk of developing diabetes again later in life.
Modifiable Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes:

Weight Management: Being overweight or obese increases risk. Maintaining a healthy weight can lower it.
Physical Activity: Regular physical activity helps lower insulin resistance. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities.
Blood Pressure: Managing high blood pressure is crucial as it can complicate diabetes.
Smoking: Quitting smoking reduces the risk of diabetes and improves overall health.
Living with Diabetes:

Healthy Lifestyle Choices: Proactive management of modifiable risk factors can prevent or delay diabetes and improve quality of life.
Resources: Tools and resources for managing diabetes and reducing cardiovascular disease risk are available at KnowDiabetesbyHeart.org.

Counting Carbohydrates: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia

Counting Carbohydrates

Many foods contain carbohydrates (carbs), including:

Fruit and fruit juice
Cereal, bread, pasta, and rice
Milk and milk products, soy milk
Beans, legumes, and lentils
Starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn
Sweets like cookies, candy, cake, jam and jelly, honey, and other foods that contain added sugar
Snack foods like chips and crackers
Your body quickly turns carbohydrates into a sugar called glucose, which is your body's main source of energy. This raises your blood sugar, or blood glucose level.

Most foods that contain carbohydrates are nutritious and are an important part of a healthy diet. For diabetes, the goal is not to avoid carbohydrates in the diet completely, but to make sure that you are not eating too many. Eating a regular amount of carbohydrates throughout the day can help keep your blood sugar level steady.

People with diabetes can better control their blood sugar if they count how many carbohydrates they eat. People with diabetes who take insulin can use carb counting to help them determine the exact dose of insulin they need at meals.

Your dietitian or diabetes educator will teach you a technique called "carb counting."

Types of Carbohydrates

Your body turns all carbohydrates into energy. There are 3 major types of carbohydrates:

Sugars
Starches
Fiber
Sugars are found naturally in some foods and added to others. Sugar occurs naturally in these nutrient-rich foods:

Fruits
Milk and milk products
Many packaged and refined foods contain added sugar:

Candy
Cookies, cakes, and pastries
Regular (non-diet) carbonated beverages, such as soda
Heavy syrups, such as those added to canned fruit
Starches are found naturally in foods, as well. Your body breaks them down into sugar after you eat them. The following foods have a lot of starch. Many also have fiber. Fiber is the part of food that is not broken down by the body. It slows digestion and helps you feel fuller. Foods containing starch and fiber include:

Bread
Cereal
Legumes, such as beans and chickpeas
Pasta
Rice
Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes
Counting Your Carbs

Some foods, such as jelly beans, contain only carbohydrates. Other foods, such as animal proteins (all kinds of meat, fish, and eggs), have no carbohydrates.

Most foods, even vegetables, have some carbohydrates. But most green, non-starchy vegetables are very low in carbohydrates.

Most adults with diabetes should eat no more than 200 carbohydrate grams per day. The daily recommended amount for adults is 135 grams per day, but each person should have their own carbohydrate goal. Pregnant women need at least 175 grams of carbohydrates each day.

Packaged foods have labels that tell you how many carbohydrates a food has. They are measured in grams. You can use food labels to count the carbohydrates that you eat. When you are carb counting, a serving (sometimes also called a "carb") equals an amount of food that contains 15 grams of carbohydrate. The serving size listed on a package is not always the same as 1 serving in carbohydrate counting. For example, if a single-serving package of food contains 30 grams of carbohydrate, the package actually contains 2 servings when you are carb counting.

The food label will say what 1 serving size is and how many servings are in the package. If a bag of chips says that it contains 2 servings and you eat the entire bag, then you will need to multiply the label information by 2 to know how much of the nutrients you have eaten. For example, let's say the label on a bag of chips states that it contains 2 servings, and 1 serving of chips provides 11 grams of carbohydrate. If you eat the entire bag of chips, you have eaten 22 grams of carbohydrates.

The label will list sugar and fiber separately. The carbohydrate count for a food includes sugar and fiber plus the starch. The grams of starch are not explicitly indicated on the nutrition facts label. Use only the total number to count your carbs.

When you count carbs in foods that you cook, you will have to measure the portion of food after cooking it. For example, cooked long grain rice has 15 grams of carbohydrate per 1/3 cup. If you eat a cup of cooked long grain rice, you will be eating 45 grams of carbohydrates, or 3 carbohydrate servings.

Here are some examples of foods and servings sizes that have approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate:

Half cup (107 grams) of canned fruit (without the juice or syrup)
One cup (109 grams) of melon or berries
Two tablespoons (19 grams) of dried fruit (such as raisins)
Half cup (121 grams) of cooked oatmeal
One-third cup of cooked pasta (44 grams) (can vary with the shape)
One-third cup (67 grams) of cooked long grain rice
One-fourth cup (51 grams) of cooked short grain rice
Half cup (88 grams) cooked beans, peas, or corn
One 1 oz (28 grams) slice of bread
Three cups (33 grams) popcorn (popped)
One cup (240 milliliters) milk or soy milk
Three ounces (84 grams) of baked potato
Adding up Your Carbohydrates

The total amount of carbohydrates you eat in a day is the sum of the carbohydrates in everything you eat.

When you are learning how to count carbs, use a log book, a sheet of paper, or an app to help you track them. As time passes, it will get easier to estimate your carbohydrates.

Plan to see a dietitian every 6 months. This will help you refresh your knowledge of carb counting. A dietitian can help you determine the right amount of carbohydrate servings to eat each day, based on your personal caloric needs and other factors. The dietitian can also recommend how to distribute your daily carbohydrate intake evenly among your meals and snacks.

Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young: MedlinePlus Genetics
Source: National Institutes of Health / National Library of Medicine
URL: Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young

Description
Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a group of several conditions characterized by abnormally high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. These forms of diabetes typically begin before age 30, although they can occur later in life. In MODY, elevated blood glucose arises from reduced production of insulin, which is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps regulate blood glucose levels. Specifically, insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells, where it is used as an energy source.

The different types of MODY are distinguished by their genetic causes. The most common types are HNF1A-MODY (also known as MODY3), accounting for 50 to 70 percent of cases, and GCK-MODY (MODY2), accounting for 30 to 50 percent of cases. Less frequent types include HNF4A-MODY (MODY1) and renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome (also known as HNF1B-MODY or MODY5), which each account for 5 to 10 percent of cases. At least ten other types have been identified, and these are very rare.

HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY have similar signs and symptoms that develop slowly over time. Early signs and symptoms in these types are caused by high blood glucose and may include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, blurred vision, weight loss, and recurrent skin infections. Over time, uncontrolled high blood glucose can damage small blood vessels in the eyes and kidneys. Damage to the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) causes a condition known as diabetic retinopathy that can lead to vision loss and eventual blindness. Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy) can lead to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While these two types of MODY are very similar, certain features are particular to each type. For example, babies with HNF4A-MODY tend to weigh more than average or have abnormally low blood glucose at birth, even though other signs of the condition do not occur until childhood or young adulthood. People with HNF1A-MODY have a higher-than-average risk of developing noncancerous (benign) liver tumors known as hepatocellular adenomas.

GCK-MODY is a very mild type of the condition. People with this type have slightly elevated blood glucose levels, particularly in the morning before eating (fasting blood glucose). However, affected individuals often have no symptoms related to the disorder, and diabetes-related complications are extremely rare.

Frequency
MODY is estimated to account for 1 to 3 percent of all cases of diabetes.

Causes
MODY can be caused by a mutation in one of several genes. HNF1A-MODY, GCK-MODY, HNF4A-MODY, and RCAD are caused by mutations in the HNF1A, GCK, HNF4A, and HNF1B genes, respectively. All of these genes provide instructions for making proteins involved in the production of insulin to control blood glucose levels in the body. In particular, the proteins are important in specialized cells in the pancreas called beta cells, which secrete insulin.

The proteins produced from the HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF1B genes all act as transcription factors, which means they control the activity of other genes. In particular, these proteins regulate genes that direct the development and function of beta cells. HNF1A, HNF4A, or HNF1B gene mutations result in the production of an altered transcription factor that is unable to function normally. These changes alter gene activity in cells, impairing normal beta cell development and function. As a result, beta cells are less able than normal to produce insulin in response to glucose in the blood, which means the body cannot control blood glucose. Elevated blood glucose results in the signs and symptoms of MODY. Some of these MODY-related genes play roles in the development of other body systems, in addition to beta cells. Disrupted development of these systems underlies additional signs and symptoms in particular forms of MODY. For example, the HNF1B gene is involved in kidney development, which helps explain the kidney abnormalities in people with RCAD.

The protein produced from the GCK gene acts as a sensor that recognizes when the amount of glucose in the blood rises. In response, the protein helps stimulate the release of insulin from beta cells so glucose can be taken up and used by cells for energy. This protein also helps determine when excess glucose should be taken into liver cells and stored. Mutations in the GCK gene limit the protein's ability to sense a rise in blood glucose, so levels remain elevated.

Other genes involved in controlling blood glucose cause rare types of MODY. It is likely that additional genes that have not been identified are also involved in the condition.

Inheritance
MODY is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

Tips for Traveling With Diabetes | Diabetes | CDC
If you're going through security at the airport, there's good news: people with diabetes can bring over 3.4 ounces of liquids through security in their carry-ons. This allows them to travel with liquid medicines, fast-acting sugar sources like juice, or gel packs to keep insulin cool. Finally, be aware that insulin pumps or continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) could be damaged by X-ray machines. Instead of disconnecting your devices, you can ask for a hand inspection.

While you're traveling
Bring healthy foods

Consider available food options while you travel by car, airplane, or train. If you're driving, bring a cooler with healthy foods and plenty of water. If you're flying, bring options like fruit or nuts so you don't have to resort to unhealthy convenience foods.

Find healthy options

Some ideas at airports or roadside restaurants include:

Fresh fruit with nuts.
Sandwiches on whole wheat bread with grilled chicken or fish.
Salad with grilled chicken or fish - limit higher fat toppings such as cheese or creamy dressings.
Scrambled or hard boiled eggs.
Burgers with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.
Fajitas without tortillas and rice.
Watch the heat
Keep an eye on the temperature if you're traveling somewhere warm. High temperatures, dehydration, and even sunburns can impact your blood sugar.

Don't forget your feet
Exploring a new place could mean blisters or cuts on your feet. Be sure to check your feet every day, so you can take care of any problems. Avoid walking barefoot, even on the beach.

Managing Diabetes During a Hospital Stay
Source: The Joint Commission, the largest health care accrediting body in the United States, promotes quality and safety in health care organizations.

Living with diabetes can make you adept at managing the ups and downs of the disease, whether you're handling sick days, a trip to the store, or even a trip across the country. However, going to the hospital presents new challenges. It’s crucial not to let your diabetes care take a back seat while you’re hospitalized. Always be an active participant in your care.

Preparation Before Hospital Admission:

Consult with Your Doctor or Diabetes Educator: Before going to the hospital, discuss your diabetes management with your healthcare team.
Emergency Room Information: Ensure that hospital staff know how to contact your diabetes care team if you go to the emergency room.
Appoint an Advocate: Have a trusted family member or friend act as your advocate to ask questions and help manage your care.
Five Key Actions to Manage Your Diabetes in the Hospital:

Find Out How Your Diabetes Will Be Managed:

Do not assume that hospital staff know how to manage your diabetes. Ensure your diabetes care team collaborates with hospital caregivers.
Remind Caregivers About Your Diabetes: Do not hesitate to remind hospital staff that you have diabetes.
Wear Your Diabetes ID: Always wear your diabetes ID. If you need to remove it for a test or treatment, remember to put it back on.
Discuss Changes to Your Care Plan: Ask about any changes to your diabetes care plan.
Blood Sugar Monitoring: Inquire how often and when your blood sugar will be checked.
Insulin Management: If you take insulin at home, ask the hospital doctor to write insulin orders for the nurses to follow.
Insulin Pump Usage: If you use an insulin pump, ask if you can continue using it during your hospital stay.
Report Symptoms: Inform the nurse if you experience symptoms of low or high blood sugar.
Manage Your Medications:

Medication History: Inform hospital staff about any problems or reactions you have had to medications in the past.
Pre-Hospitalization Medication: Ask which medications you should stop before your hospital stay.
Hospital Medication: Inquire about the medicines being given to you and why. Keep a log if you tend to forget.
Nausea and Medications: Ask what to do if you feel sick and cannot keep your medicine down.
Medication Timing: Ensure medications are given on time, especially rapid-acting insulin.
Surgical Medications: Ask if blood sugar will be affected by anesthesia and post-surgical medications.
Insulin Administration: If you are given insulin, ask about the type and timing, even if you do not normally take it.
Diet Management:

Dietary Preferences: Discuss your food preferences with the hospital dietitian.
Meal Adjustments: Ask if meals will be adjusted to help maintain target blood sugar levels.
Timing Issues: Know what to do if meals are late, blood sugar checks are missed, or medications are delayed.
Non-Eating Protocol: Understand how blood sugar will be managed if you cannot eat.
Normal Meals: Find out when you can resume normal meals.
Visitor Food: Inform the nurse if a visitor brings food, as insulin adjustments may be needed.
Prepare for Discharge:

Post-Hospital Expectations: Have your doctor explain what to expect after leaving the hospital, including follow-up care.
Understand Instructions: Ensure you or your advocate understands all instructions.
Follow-Up Care: Know when and why you should see your doctor for follow-up visits.
Infection Prevention:

Hand Hygiene: Ensure caregivers wash their hands; do not hesitate to remind them if they don’t.
Clean Gloves: Caregivers should wear clean gloves; remind them if necessary.
Report Issues: Inform nurses about any cuts, sores, or bruises that haven’t healed.
Personal Hygiene: Remember to wash your own hands.
Sick Visitors: Ask ill relatives or friends to wait until they are better before visiting.
Vaccinations: Ensure you get a flu shot annually and keep your pneumonia vaccine current.
Post-Hospital Considerations:

Insulin Management at Home: If you are discharged with insulin, ensure you understand how to administer it and know how long you’ll need it.
Wound Healing: Inquire about the expected healing time for wounds.
Resuming Normal Activities: Find out when you can return to normal exercise, medications, and diet.
The Goal of the Speak Up™ Program:
The Joint Commission’s Speak Up™ program aims to help patients and their advocates become more informed and involved in their health care.

Clinical Trials for Diabetes, Heart Disease, & Stroke
Key Points
Link Between Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Stroke
Diabetes increases the likelihood of developing heart disease.
High blood glucose can damage blood vessels and nerves that control the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart disease.
Adults with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as adults without diabetes.
Managing diabetes helps lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Additional Risk Factors for Heart Disease or Stroke with Diabetes
Smoking: Increases risk due to narrowing of blood vessels.
High Blood Pressure: Strains the heart and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other complications.
Abnormal Cholesterol Levels: High LDL (bad cholesterol) and low HDL (good cholesterol) can lead to clogged blood vessels.
Obesity and Belly Fat: Increases the risk for heart disease and high blood pressure.
Chronic Kidney Disease: Diabetes is a significant risk factor, affecting about 40% of diabetics.
Family History: Increases the likelihood of developing heart disease.
Lowering Chances of Heart Attack or Stroke
Manage Diabetes ABCs:
A1C test: Aim for below 7%.
Blood Pressure: Goal is below 140/90 mm Hg.
Cholesterol: Manage levels with diet and medication.
Stop Smoking: Essential for reducing risks.
Healthy Lifestyle Habits: Include a balanced diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and adequate sleep.
Manage Stress: Techniques like yoga, deep breathing, and hobbies can help.
Medication: Follow prescriptions to manage blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol.
Diagnosing Heart Disease in People with Diabetes
Based on medical and family history, physical exams, and test results.
Regular monitoring of A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
Warning Signs of Heart Attack and Stroke
Heart Attack: Chest pain or pressure, discomfort in arms/shoulders, back, neck, jaw, sweating, light-headedness, indigestion, and extreme fatigue.
Stroke: Sudden weakness or numbness on one side, confusion, trouble speaking, dizziness, balance issues, vision problems, and severe headache.
Clinical Trials for Diabetes, Heart Disease, & Stroke
NIDDK supports research to prevent, detect, and treat these conditions.
Trials study risk factors, improved diagnostic techniques, genetics, and more.

Diabetes in Older People
What is diabetes?
Diabetes is a serious disease that affects many older adults. It occurs when a person's blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. The good news is that you can take steps to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of the disease to develop in older adults. If you already have diabetes, there are ways to manage the condition and help prevent diabetes-related health problems.

Types of diabetes:
Type 1 diabetes: The body makes little or no insulin. Although older adults can develop type 1 diabetes, it begins most often in children and young adults, who then have diabetes for life. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day.
Type 2 diabetes: The body's cells don't use insulin properly. It occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults but can also affect children. Risk factors include overweight or obesity, an inactive lifestyle, family history of diabetes, or a history of gestational diabetes. People who are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk.
Symptoms of diabetes:
Symptoms may include feeling tired, increased hunger or thirst, losing weight without trying, urinating often, and numbness or tingling in hands or feet. Other symptoms include blurred vision, skin infections, and slower healing from cuts and bruises. In type 2 diabetes, symptoms often develop slowly and may go unnoticed for a long time. Some people may have no symptoms and only find out they have diabetes when other health problems develop.

Tests for diabetes:
Doctors use several blood tests to diagnose diabetes:

Fasting plasma glucose test: Measures blood glucose after fasting for at least eight hours.
A1C test: Shows average blood glucose level over the past three months.
Random plasma glucose test: Measures blood glucose at any time without fasting.
Oral glucose tolerance test: Measures blood glucose after fasting overnight and again two hours after drinking a sugary drink.
Managing type 2 diabetes:
Managing diabetes may involve lifestyle changes, medication, or both. Some key aspects of management include:

Tracking glucose levels: Checking glucose levels regularly.
Making healthy food choices: Learning what foods to eat, how much, and when.
Being active: Regular exercise to improve glucose levels.
Taking medicines: Following prescriptions and managing any side effects.
Managing blood pressure and cholesterol: Regular checks to reduce the risk of heart disease and other complications.
Stopping smoking: Reduces the risk of many health problems.
Regular screenings: Eye exams, kidney checks, flu shots, and cancer screenings to prevent complications.
Daily care: Keeping up with personal care routines like foot care and dental health.
Help with diabetes costs:
Both private health insurance and government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans' health care) may help pay for diabetes care. It's important to understand what is covered, including medications, supplies, and visits to medical specialists. If you have trouble paying for your diabetes care, talk to your health care team about less expensive options or generic versions of your medications.

Healthy Digestion and Converting Foods into Energy
Understanding How Our Bodies Handle Sugars and Energy
1. Digestive System Breakdown:

Nutrient Conversion: Food is broken down into nutrients in the digestive system.
Carbohydrates to Glucose: Carbohydrates in our foods are broken down and converted to glucose.
Energy Distribution: Blood circulates glucose throughout the body, providing energy to cells or storing it as fat ("stored energy").
Uses of Energy: The body uses energy stored in glucose as fuel for activities such as exercising, thinking, growing, and healing.
2. Role of Insulin:

Insulin Production: Cells in the pancreas respond to higher glucose levels in the blood by producing insulin.
Glucose Absorption: With insulin's help, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy.
Diabetes Complications:

Insufficient Insulin Production: The pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels.
Insulin Resistance: Cells become resistant to insulin, failing to take up glucose from the blood, resulting in higher blood sugar levels.
Symptoms of Diabetes:

Frequent urination, especially at night
Excessive thirst

Clinical Trials for Healthy Living with Diabetes
Healthy living is a way to manage diabetes. To have a healthy lifestyle, take steps now to plan healthy meals and snacks, do physical activities, get enough sleep, and quit smoking or using tobacco products.

Healthy living may help keep your body's blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose level, also called blood sugar level, in the range your primary health care professional recommends. Your primary health care professional may be a doctor, a physician assistant, or a nurse practitioner. Healthy living may also help prevent or delay health problems from diabetes that can affect your heart, kidneys, eyes, brain, and other parts of your body.

Making lifestyle changes can be hard, but starting with small changes and building from there may benefit your health. You may want to get help from family, loved ones, friends, and other trusted people in your community. You can also get information from your health care professionals.

How can I plan what to eat or drink when I have diabetes?

What you choose to eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are parts of a meal plan. Having healthy foods and drinks can help keep your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in the ranges your health care professional recommends. If you have overweight or obesity, a healthy meal plan—along with regular physical activity, getting enough sleep, and other healthy behaviors—may help you reach and maintain a healthy weight. In some cases, health care professionals may also recommend diabetes medicines that may help you lose weight, or weight-loss surgery, also called metabolic and bariatric surgery.

Choose healthy foods and drinks

There is no right or wrong way to choose healthy foods and drinks that may help manage your diabetes. Healthy meal plans for people who have diabetes may include:

Dairy or plant-based dairy products
Fruits
Nonstarchy vegetables
Protein foods
Whole grains
Try to choose foods that include nutrients such as vitamins, calcium, fiber, healthy fats. Also, try to choose drinks with little or no added sugar, such as tap or bottled water, low-fat or non-fat milk, and unsweetened tea, coffee, or sparkling water.

Try to plan meals and snacks that have fewer:

Foods high in saturated fat
Foods high in sodium, a mineral found in salt
Sugary foods, such as cookies and cakes, and sweet drinks, such as soda, juice, flavored coffee, and sports drinks
Your body turns carbohydrates, or carbs, from food into glucose, which can raise your blood glucose level. Some fruits, beans, and starchy vegetables—such as potatoes and corn—have more carbs than other foods. Keep carbs in mind when planning your meals.

You should also limit how much alcohol you drink. If you take insulin or certain diabetes medicines, drinking alcohol can make your blood glucose level drop too low, which is called hypoglycemia. If you do drink alcohol, be sure to eat food when you drink and remember to check your blood glucose level after drinking. Talk with your health care team about your alcohol-drinking habits.

Find the best times to eat or drink

Talk with your health care professional or health care team about when you should eat or drink. The best time to have meals and snacks may depend on:

What medicines you take for diabetes
What your level of physical activity or your work schedule is
Whether you have other health conditions or diseases
Ask your health care team if you should eat before, during, or after physical activity. Some diabetes medicines, such as sulfonylureas or insulin, may make your blood glucose level drop too low during exercise or if you skip or delay a meal.

Plan how much to eat or drink

You may worry that having diabetes means giving up foods and drinks you enjoy. The good news is you can still have your favorite foods and drinks, but you might need to have them in smaller portions or enjoy them less often.

For people who have diabetes, carb counting and the plate method are two common ways to plan how much to eat or drink. Talk with your health care professional or health care team to find a method that works for you.

Carb counting

Carbohydrate counting, or carb counting, means planning and keeping track of the amount of carbs you eat and drink in each meal or snack. Not all people with diabetes need to count carbs. However, if you take insulin, counting carbs can help you know how much insulin to take.

Plate method

The plate method helps you control portion sizes without counting and measuring. This method divides a 9-inch plate into the following three sections to help you choose the types and amounts of foods to eat for each meal.

Nonstarchy vegetables—such as leafy greens, peppers, carrots, or green beans—should make up half of your plate.
Carb foods that are high in fiber—such as brown rice, whole grains, beans, or fruits—should make up one-quarter of your plate.
Protein foods—such as lean meats, fish, dairy, or tofu or other soy products—should make up one-quarter of your plate.
If you are not taking insulin, you may not need to count carbs when using the plate method.

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

The plate method may help you control your blood glucose without counting carbs.

Work with your health care team to create a meal plan that works for you. You may want to have a diabetes educator or a registered dietitian on your team. A registered dietitian can provide medical nutrition therapy, which includes counseling to help you create and follow a meal plan. Your health care team may be able to recommend other resources, such as a healthy lifestyle coach, to help you with making changes. Ask your health care team or your insurance company if your benefits include medical nutrition therapy or other diabetes care resources.

Talk with your health care professional before taking dietary supplements

There is no clear proof that specific foods, herbs, spices, or dietary supplements—such as vitamins or minerals—can help manage diabetes. Your health care professional may ask you to take vitamins or minerals if you can't get enough from foods. Talk with your health care professional before you take any supplements, because some may cause side effects or affect how well your diabetes medicines work.

How can physical activity help manage my diabetes?

Research shows that regular physical activity helps people manage their diabetes and stay healthy. Benefits of physical activity may include:

Lower blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels
Better heart health
Healthier weight
Better mood and sleep
Better balance and memory
Talk with your health care professional before starting a new physical activity or changing how much physical activity you do. They may suggest types of activities based on your ability, schedule, meal plan, interests, and diabetes medicines. Your health care professional may also tell you the best times of day to be active or what to do if your blood glucose level goes out of the range recommended for you.

Physical activity may help you manage your diabetes and stay healthy.

Do different types of physical activity

People with diabetes can be active, even if they take insulin or use technology such as insulin pumps.

Try to do different kinds of activities. While being more active may have more health benefits, any physical activity is better than none. Start slowly with activities you enjoy. You may be able to change your level of effort and try other activities over time. Having a friend or family member join you may help you stick to your routine.

The physical activities you do may need to be different if you are age 65 or older, are pregnant, or have a disability or health condition. Physical activities may also need to be different for children and teens. Ask your health care professional or health care team about activities that are safe for you.

Aerobic activities

Aerobic activities make you breathe harder and make your heart beat faster. You can try walking, dancing, wheelchair rolling, or swimming. Most adults should try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. Aim to do 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. You don't have to do all 30 minutes at one time. You can break up physical activity into small amounts during your day and still get the benefit.

Strength training or resistance training

Strength training or resistance training may make your muscles and bones stronger. You can try lifting weights or doing other exercises such as wall pushups or arm raises. Try to do this kind of training two times a week.

Balance and stretching activities

Balance and stretching activities may help you move better and have stronger muscles and bones. You may want to try standing on one leg or stretching your legs when sitting on the floor. Try to do these kinds of activities two or three times a week.

Some activities that need balance may be unsafe for people with nerve damage or vision problems caused by diabetes. Ask your health care professional or health care team about activities that are safe for you.

If you can, try to do different types of physical activities. Start slowly with activities you enjoy.

Stay safe during physical activity

Staying safe during physical activity is important. Here are some tips to keep in mind.

Drink liquids

Drinking liquids helps prevent dehydration, or the loss of too much water in your body. Drinking water is a way to stay hydrated. Sports drinks often have a lot of sugar and calories, and you don't need them for most moderate physical activities.

Avoid low blood glucose

Check your blood glucose level before, during, and right after physical activity. Physical activity often lowers the level of glucose in your blood. Low blood glucose levels may last for hours or days after physical activity. You are most likely to have low blood glucose if you take insulin or some other diabetes medicines, such as sulfonylureas.

Ask your health care professional if you should take less insulin or eat carbs before, during, or after physical activity. Low blood glucose can be a serious medical emergency that must be treated right away. Take steps to protect yourself. You can learn how to treat low blood glucose, let other people know what to do if you need help, and use a medical alert bracelet.

Avoid high blood glucose and ketoacidosis

Taking less insulin before physical activity may help prevent low blood glucose, but it may also make you more likely to have high blood glucose. If your body does not have enough insulin, it can't use glucose as a source of energy and will use fat instead. When your body uses fat for energy, your body makes chemicals called ketones.

High levels of ketones in your blood can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a medical emergency that should be treated right away. DKA is most common in people with type 1 diabetes. Occasionally, DKA may affect people with type 2 diabetes who have lost their ability to produce insulin. Ask your health care professional how much insulin you should take before physical activity, whether you need to test your urine for ketones, and what level of ketones is dangerous for you.

Take care of your feet

People with diabetes may have problems with their feet because high blood glucose levels can damage blood vessels and nerves. To help prevent foot problems, wear comfortable and supportive shoes and take care of your feet before, during, and after physical activity.

What can I do to reach or maintain a healthy weight?

If you have diabetes, managing your weight may bring you several health benefits. Ask your health care professional or health care team if you are at a healthy weight or if you should try to lose weight.

If you are an adult with overweight or obesity, work with your health care team to create a weight-loss plan. Losing 5% to 7% of your current weight may help you prevent or improve some health problems and manage your blood glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels.

If you are worried about your child's weight and they have diabetes, talk with their health care professional before your child starts a new weight-loss plan.

You may be able to reach and maintain a healthy weight by:

Following a healthy meal plan
Consuming fewer calories
Being physically active
Getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night
If you have type 2 diabetes, your health care professional may recommend diabetes medicines that may help you lose weight.

Online tools such as the Body Weight Planner may help you create eating and physical activity plans. You may want to talk with your health care professional about other options for managing your weight, including joining a weight-loss program that can provide helpful information, support, and behavioral or lifestyle counseling. These options may have a cost, so make sure to check the details of the programs.

Your health care professional may recommend weight-loss surgery if you aren't able to reach a healthy weight with meal planning, physical activity, and taking diabetes medicines that help with weight loss.

If you are pregnant, trying to lose weight may not be healthy. However, you should ask your health care professional whether it makes sense to monitor or limit your weight gain during pregnancy.

Should I quit smoking?

Both diabetes and smoking—including using tobacco products and e-cigarettes—cause your blood vessels to narrow. Both diabetes and smoking increase your risk of having a heart attack or stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, eye disease, or amputation. Secondhand smoke can also affect the health of your family or others who live with you.

If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help. You don't have to do it alone.

How can I take care of my mental health?

Feeling stressed, sad, or angry can be common for people with diabetes. Managing diabetes or learning to cope with new information about your health can be hard. People with chronic illnesses such as diabetes may develop anxiety or other mental health conditions.

Learn healthy ways to lower your stress, and ask for help from your health care team or a mental health professional. While it may be uncomfortable to talk about your feelings, finding a health care professional whom you trust and want to talk with may help you:

Lower your feelings of stress, depression, or anxiety
Manage problems sleeping or remembering things
See how diabetes affects your family, school, work, or financial situation
Ask your health care team for mental health resources for people with diabetes.

Sleeping too much or too little may raise your blood glucose levels. Your sleep habits may also affect your mental health and vice versa. People with diabetes and overweight or obesity can also have other health conditions that affect sleep, such as sleep apnea, which can raise your blood pressure and risk of heart disease.

Having diabetes can be stressful. Talk with your health care professional or health care team if you need help.

Clinical Trials for Healthy Living with Diabetes

NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.

What are clinical trials for healthy living with diabetes?

Clinical trials—and other types of clinical studies—are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help health care professionals and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.

Researchers are studying many aspects of healthy living for people with diabetes, such as:

How changing when you eat may affect body weight and metabolism
How less access to healthy foods may affect diabetes management, other health problems, and risk of dying
Whether low-carbohydrate meal plans can help lower blood glucose levels
Which diabetes medicines are more likely to help people lose weight
Find out if clinical trials are right for you.

Watch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.

Why Should I Join a Clinical Trial?

What clinical trials for healthy living with diabetes are looking for participants?

You can view a filtered list of clinical studies on healthy living with diabetes that are federally funded, open, and recruiting at www.ClinicalTrials.gov. You can expand or narrow the list to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study.

Overview:

Having diabetes increases your likelihood of developing heart disease and stroke. This is partly because people with diabetes often have risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which further elevate their risk. By managing blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and by quitting smoking, you can protect your heart and overall health.

What is the Link Between Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Stroke?
High blood glucose from diabetes can damage blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels, leading to heart disease. People with diabetes tend to develop heart disease at a younger age and are nearly twice as likely to have heart disease or stroke as those without diabetes. Managing diabetes effectively also helps lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Risk Factors for Heart Disease or Stroke in People with Diabetes
Smoking: Increases the risk of heart disease and can exacerbate other long-term problems like lung disease, lower leg infections, ulcers, and amputations.
High Blood Pressure: Strains the heart, damages blood vessels, and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems. Regular monitoring and management are crucial.
Abnormal Cholesterol Levels: High LDL ("bad") cholesterol and low HDL ("good") cholesterol levels increase the risk of heart disease. Managing cholesterol through diet and physical activity is essential.
Obesity and Belly Fat: Excess weight and belly fat increase the risk of heart disease. A healthy diet and regular exercise can help manage weight and reduce risk.
Chronic Kidney Disease: Closely linked with heart disease, it affects about 40% of people with diabetes. Managing kidney health through diet, activity, and weight control is important.
Family History of Heart Disease: Increases the risk, especially if a family member had a heart attack before age 50. Preventive measures are crucial for those with a family history.
Lowering the Chances of Heart Attack or Stroke
Manage Diabetes ABCs:

A1C Test: Shows average blood glucose over the past 3 months. The goal for many is below 7%.
Blood Pressure: Aim for below 140/90 mm Hg.
Cholesterol: Keep levels within the target range. Medication may be needed for some.
Stop Smoking: Reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other complications.
Healthy Lifestyle Habits:

Healthy Eating Plan: Follow a diet that supports blood glucose management.
Regular Physical Activity: Incorporate exercise into your routine to help manage diabetes and cope with stress.
Healthy Weight: Maintain or achieve a healthy weight.
Adequate Sleep: Ensure sufficient rest.
Stress Management: Practice stress-reducing activities like yoga, walking, and hobbies.

Medication Management:

Take Prescribed Medications: Follow the doctor's instructions for diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol medications.
Aspirin and Statins: Consult your doctor about the need for these medications to protect your heart.
Diagnosing Heart Disease in People with Diabetes
Doctors use medical and family history, physical exams, and test results to diagnose heart disease in people with diabetes. Regular monitoring of A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol helps determine the need for additional heart health tests or specialist referrals.

Warning Signs of Heart Attack and Stroke
Heart Attack: Chest pain or pressure, pain in arms, shoulders, back, neck, or jaw, sweating, light-headedness, nausea, extreme fatigue.
Stroke: Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, confusion, trouble talking or understanding, dizziness, vision problems, severe headache.
Immediate treatment is crucial. Call 9-1-1 if you experience these symptoms.

Clinical Trials
The NIDDK supports clinical trials to improve prevention, detection, and treatment of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Participation helps advance medical research and care.

KEY POINTS
Untreated mental health issues can make diabetes worse.
Problems with diabetes can make mental health issues worse.
Fortunately, if one gets better, the other tends to get better too.
ON THIS PAGE
Why it's important
Depression: more than just a bad mood
Stress and anxiety
Diabetes distress
Talk to your health care team
Why it's important
Is mental health pretty low on your list of priorities for managing diabetes? This may change your mind. Mental health has an impact on so many parts of daily life. It affects how you think and feel, handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. You can see how a mental health problem could make it harder to stick to your diabetes care plan.

The mind-body connection
Thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can affect how healthy your body is. Untreated mental health issues can make diabetes worse. Likewise, problems with diabetes can make mental health issues worse. But fortunately, if one gets better, the other tends to get better too.

Depression: more than just a bad mood
Depression is a medical illness that causes feelings of sadness. It also can cause a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy. It can get in the way of how well you function at work and home. That includes taking care of your diabetes. When you aren't able to manage your diabetes well, your risk goes up for diabetes-related health problems.

People with diabetes are 2 to 3 times more likely to have depression than people without diabetes. Only 25% to 50% of people with diabetes who have depression get diagnosed and treated. But treatment—therapy, medicine, or both—is usually very effective. And without treatment, depression often gets worse, not better.

Symptoms of depression can be mild to severe, and include:

Feeling sad or empty
Losing interest in favorite activities
Overeating or not wanting to eat at all
Not being able to sleep or sleeping too much
Having trouble concentrating or making decisions
Feeling very tired
Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty
Having aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems
Having thoughts of suicide or death
If you think you might have depression, get in touch with your doctor right away for help getting treatment. The earlier depression is treated, the better for you, your quality of life, and your diabetes.

Stress and anxiety
Stress is part of life, from traffic jams to family demands to everyday diabetes care. You can feel stress as an emotion, such as fear or anger. It can also be a physical reaction like sweating or a racing heart.

If you're stressed, you may not take care of yourself as well as usual. Your blood sugar levels can be affected too. Stress hormones make blood sugar rise or fall unpredictably. Stress from being sick or injured can make your blood sugar go up. Being stressed for a long time can lead to other health problems or make them worse.

Anxiety—feelings of worry, fear, or being on edge—is how your mind and body react to stress. People with diabetes are 20% more likely than those without diabetes to have anxiety. Managing a long-term condition like diabetes is a major source of anxiety for some.

Tips to manage stress and anxiety:
Get active: Even a quick walk can be calming, and the effect can last for hours.
Relaxation exercises: Try meditation or yoga.
Connect with a friend: Call or text a friend who understands you (not someone who is causing you stress!).
Take "you" time: Take a break from whatever you're doing. Go outside, read something fun—whatever helps you recharge.
Take care of yourself: Limit alcohol and caffeine, eat healthy food, and get enough sleep.
Anxiety can feel like low blood sugar and vice versa. It may be hard for you to recognize which it is and treat it effectively. If you're feeling anxious, try checking your blood sugar and treat it if it's low.

There will always be some stress in life. But if you feel overwhelmed, talking to a mental health counselor can help. Ask your doctor for a referral.

Diabetes distress
You may sometimes feel discouraged, worried, frustrated, or tired of dealing with daily diabetes care. Maybe you've been trying hard but not seeing results. Or you've developed a health problem related to diabetes in spite of your best efforts.

Those overwhelming feelings, known as diabetes distress, may cause you to stop taking care of yourself. You may slip into unhealthy habits, stop checking your blood sugar, even skip doctor's appointments.

It happens to many—if not most—people with diabetes, often after years of good management.

Did you know?
In any 18-month period, 33% to 50% of people with diabetes have diabetes distress.

Managing diabetes distress:
See an endocrinologist: These specialists likely have a deeper understanding of diabetes challenges than your regular doctor.
Mental health counseling: Ask your doctor to refer you to a mental health counselor who specializes in chronic health conditions.
Diabetes educator: Get some one-on-one time with a diabetes educator so you can problem-solve together.
Focus on small goals: Focus on one or two small diabetes management goals instead of thinking you have to work on everything all at once.
Talk to your health care team
Your health care team knows diabetes is challenging but may not understand how challenging. And you may not be used to talking about feeling sad or down. But if you're concerned about your mental health, let your doctor know right away. You're not alone—help is available!

Diabetes in Older People
What is diabetes?
Diabetes is a serious disease that affects many older adults. It occurs when a person's blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. The good news is that you can take steps to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of the disease to develop in older adults. If you already have diabetes, there are ways to manage the condition and help prevent diabetes-related health problems.

Types of diabetes:
Type 1 diabetes: The body makes little or no insulin. Although older adults can develop type 1 diabetes, it begins most often in children and young adults, who then have diabetes for life. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day.
Type 2 diabetes: The body's cells don't use insulin properly. It occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults but can also affect children. Risk factors include overweight or obesity, an inactive lifestyle, family history of diabetes, or a history of gestational diabetes. People who are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk.
Symptoms of diabetes:
Symptoms may include feeling tired, increased hunger or thirst, losing weight without trying, urinating often, and numbness or tingling in hands or feet. Other symptoms include blurred vision, skin infections, and slower healing from cuts and bruises. In type 2 diabetes, symptoms often develop slowly and may go unnoticed for a long time. Some people may have no symptoms and only find out they have diabetes when other health problems develop.

Tests for diabetes:
Doctors use several blood tests to diagnose diabetes:

Fasting plasma glucose test: Measures blood glucose after fasting for at least eight hours.
A1C test: Shows average blood glucose level over the past three months.
Random plasma glucose test: Measures blood glucose at any time without fasting.
Oral glucose tolerance test: Measures blood glucose after fasting overnight and again two hours after drinking a sugary drink.
Managing type 2 diabetes:
Managing diabetes may involve lifestyle changes, medication, or both. Some key aspects of management include:

Tracking glucose levels: Checking glucose levels regularly.
Making healthy food choices: Learning what foods to eat, how much, and when.
Being active: Regular exercise to improve glucose levels.
Taking medicines: Following prescriptions and managing any side effects.
Managing blood pressure and cholesterol: Regular checks to reduce the risk of heart disease and other complications.
Stopping smoking: Reduces the risk of many health problems.
Regular screenings: Eye exams, kidney checks, flu shots, and cancer screenings to prevent complications.
Daily care: Keeping up with personal care routines like foot care and dental health.
Help with diabetes costs:
Both private health insurance and government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans' health care) may help pay for diabetes care. It's important to understand what is covered, including medications, supplies, and visits to medical specialists. If you have trouble paying for your diabetes care, talk to your health care team about less expensive options or generic versions of your medications.

extract and return article: Healthy digestion and converting foods into energy 
To understand diabetes, it helps to know how our bodies handle the sugars and energy from our food and drinks. 
1. Food is broken down into nutrients in the digestive system. 
2. Carbohydrates in our foods are broken down and converted to a usable type of sugar, most often glucose. 
Blood circulates this glucose throughout the body to provide energy to cells or to store it as fat to use later. (Fat is essentially "stored energy.") The body uses energy stored in glucose as fuel to perform many activities, such as exercising, thinking, growing and healing. 
3. Insulin is needed for the body to use glucose. Cells in the pancreas respond to higher levels of glucose in the blood by producing insulin. With the help of insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for 
energy. 
In people with diabetes, this process can go wrong in two ways. Either: 
1. There isn't enough insulin. The pancreas isn't producing enough insulin to respond to the glucose in the 
blood and blood sugar levels rise. 
2. Cells are resistant to insulin. The cells no longer respond to the insulin signal to take up glucose from the 
blood and blood sugar levels rise. 
People with diabetes may have the following symptoms: 
• Urinate several times a day, especially at night 
• Excessive thirst

Changing Your Habits for Better Health - NIDDK
On this page:

What stage of change are you in?
Contemplation: Are you thinking of making changes?
Preparation: Have you made up your mind?
Action: Have you started to make changes?
Maintenance: Have you created a new routine?
Clinical Trials
Are you thinking about being more active? Have you been trying to cut back on less healthy foods? Are you starting to eat better and move more but having a hard time sticking with these changes?

Old habits die hard. Changing your habits is a process that involves several stages. Sometimes it takes a while before changes become new habits, and you may face roadblocks along the way.

Adopting new, healthier habits may protect you from serious health problems like obesity and diabetes. New habits, like healthy eating and regular physical activity, may also help you manage your weight and have more energy. After a while, if you stick with these changes, they may become part of your daily routine.

The information below outlines four stages you may go through when changing your health habits or behavior. You will also find tips to help you improve your eating, physical activity habits, and overall health.

The Four Stages of Changing a Health Behavior
Contemplation: "I'm thinking about it."

In this first stage, you are thinking about change and becoming motivated to get started.
Indicators:
Considering change but not quite ready to start
Believing that health, energy level, or overall well-being will improve with new habits
Unsure how to overcome roadblocks
Preparation: "I have made up my mind to take action."

Indicators:
Decided to change and are ready to take action
Set specific goals
Getting ready to put the plan into action
Action: "I have started to make changes."

Indicators:
Making eating, physical activity, and other behavior changes in the last 6 months
Adjusting to eating healthier, being more active, making other changes
Trying to overcome things that block success
Maintenance: "I have a new routine."

Indicators:
Changes have become part of the routine for more than 6 months
Found creative ways to stick with the routine
Overcoming slip-ups and setbacks
Did You Find Your Stage of Change?
Contemplation: Are you thinking of making changes?

Making the leap from thinking about change to taking action can be hard and may take time. Asking yourself about the pros (benefits) and cons (things that get in the way) of changing your habits may be helpful. Consider how the benefits of healthy eating or regular physical activity might relate to your overall health.
Preparation: Have you made up your mind?

Look at your list of pros and cons. Think about possible solutions to overcome roadblocks as you begin to change your habits.
Action: Have you started to make changes?

Review your plan, look at the goals you set, and how well you are meeting them. Track your progress and reward yourself for your hard work.
Maintenance: Have you created a new routine?

Keep things interesting, avoid slip-ups, and find ways to cope with what life throws at you. Add variety and stay motivated. Plan ahead to avoid setbacks.
Clinical Trials
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses. Find out if clinical trials are right for you.

A1C Test: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia
URL of this page: MedlinePlus A1C Test

A1C Test
A1C is a lab test that shows the average level of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous 3 months. It indicates how well you are controlling your blood sugar to help prevent complications from diabetes.

How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. Two methods are available:

Blood drawn from a vein: This is done at a lab.
Finger stick: This can be done in your health care provider's office or with a prescribed kit for home use. Results may differ slightly from those of blood drawn from a vein but can be used to monitor treatment.
How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is needed. The food you have recently eaten does not affect the A1C test, so fasting is not necessary.

How the Test Will Feel

Finger stick: You may feel slight pain.
Blood drawn from a vein: You may feel a slight pinch or stinging when the needle is inserted, followed by possible throbbing or a slight bruise that soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed

Your provider may order this test if you have diabetes to monitor your control over the condition. It may also be used to screen for diabetes.

Normal Results

When used to diagnose diabetes:

Normal (no diabetes): Less than 5.7%
Pre-diabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%
Diabetes: 6.5% or higher
If you have diabetes, the goal is often to keep the level below 7%. Discuss your specific target range with your provider.

Factors Affecting Results

Conditions such as anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, and certain blood disorders (thalassemia) can affect the results. Certain medications can also result in a false A1C level. Discuss any existing conditions or medications with your provider.

What Abnormal Results Mean

An abnormal result indicates high blood sugar levels over weeks to months.

If A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes.
If you have diabetes and your A1C is above 7%, your blood sugar control may need improvement. Discuss with your provider to determine your target A1C.
Estimated Average Glucose (eAG)

Some labs use A1C to calculate an eAG, which may differ from your actual blood sugar readings from a glucose meter or continuous glucose monitor. Actual readings are usually more reliable.

Risks

There is little risk involved with blood tests. Potential risks include:

Excessive bleeding
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Fainting or lightheadedness
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (slight risk whenever skin is broken)

What is the A1C test?
How can my racial/ethnic background affect the results of my A1C test?
What are some common hemoglobin variants?
How will I know if I have a hemoglobin variant?
How can hemoglobin variants affect the A1C test and my diabetes care?
How can I know if my diabetes is well controlled if I have a hemoglobin variant?
What is the A1C test?
The A1C test is a blood test that provides information about average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. It is also called hemoglobin A1C, HbA1C, or glycated hemoglobin.
The test measures the amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin in red blood cells. The higher the glucose levels, the more it binds to hemoglobin.
Results are reported as a percentage; a normal A1C level is below 5.7 percent.
How can my racial/ethnic background affect the results of my A1C test?
The form of hemoglobin depends on inherited genes. Common forms include hemoglobin A, while less common forms are called hemoglobin variants.
Hemoglobin variants can affect A1C test results and are more common in regions like Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean.
What are some common hemoglobin variants?
Hemoglobin S (HbS): Common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans/Latinos, can cause sickle cell disease.
Hemoglobin C (HbC): Found in African Americans and people of West African descent, can cause mild symptoms and slightly enlarged spleen.
Hemoglobin E (HbE): Common in Southeast Asian descent, may cause very mild anemia and mildly enlarged spleen.
Hemoglobin D: Found in people from China, India, Turkey, Brazil, and some parts of Europe.
Hemoglobin F (Fetal Hemoglobin): Main type in unborn babies, replaced by hemoglobin A after birth, but some adults have higher levels due to certain health conditions.
How will I know if I have a hemoglobin variant?
A blood test can detect hemoglobin variants. Since 2006, states routinely screen newborns for hemoglobin S and other disorders.
Doctors may suspect a variant if your A1C test results don’t match other diabetes tests or if you have a family history of blood disorders.
How can hemoglobin variants affect the A1C test and my diabetes care?
Hemoglobin variants don’t increase the risk for diabetes but can affect A1C test results, potentially leading to mismanagement of diabetes treatment.
Falsely High A1C: May lead to unnecessary increases in diabetes medication, causing low blood glucose.
Falsely Low A1C: May result in inadequate treatment, leading to high blood glucose and increased risk of complications.
How can I know if my diabetes is well controlled if I have a hemoglobin variant?
Use an A1C test not affected by your variant. The NGSP provides information on appropriate A1C tests for specific variants.
Other options include:
Other Blood Glucose Tests: Random or fasting plasma glucose tests.
Self-Monitoring: Using a blood glucose meter at home.
Alternative Tests: Scientists are developing tests like the fructosamine test to measure average glucose levels over about 3 weeks.

High Blood Sugar - Self-Care
High blood sugar is also called high blood glucose or hyperglycemia. It almost always happens in people who have diabetes. High blood sugar occurs when:

Your body makes too little insulin.
Your body does not respond to the signal insulin is sending.
Insulin is a hormone that helps the body move glucose (sugar) from the blood into muscle or fat, where it is stored for later use when energy is needed.

Sometimes high blood sugar occurs due to stress from surgery, infection, trauma, or medicines. After the stress is over, blood sugar returns to normal.

Symptoms of High Blood Sugar
Symptoms can include:

Being very thirsty or having a dry mouth
Having blurry vision
Having dry skin
Feeling weak or tired
Needing to urinate a lot, or needing to get up more often than usual at night to urinate
More serious symptoms can occur if your blood sugar becomes very high or remains high for a long time. Over time, high blood sugar weakens your immune system and makes it more likely for you to get infections.

Managing High Blood Sugar
If you have diabetes, here are some questions to ask yourself when your blood sugar is high:

Are you eating right?
Are you eating too much?
Have you been following your diabetes meal plan?
Did you have a meal or a snack with a lot of carbohydrates, starches, or simple sugars?
Are you taking your diabetes medicines correctly?
Has your health care provider changed your medicines?
If you take insulin, have you been taking the correct dose? Is the insulin expired? Or has it been stored in a hot or cold place?
Are you afraid of having low blood sugar? Is that causing you to eat too much or take too little insulin or other diabetes medicine?
Have you injected insulin into a scar or overused area? Have you been rotating sites? Was the injection into a lump or numb spot under the skin?
What else has changed?
Have you been less active than usual?
Do you have a fever, cold, flu, or another illness?
Are you dehydrated?
Have you had some stress?
Have you been checking your blood sugar regularly?
Have you gained weight?
Have you started taking any new medicines such as for high blood pressure or other medical problems?
Have you had an injection into a joint or other area with a glucocorticoid medicine?
Preventing High Blood Sugar
To prevent high blood sugar, you will need to:

Follow your meal plan
Stay physically active
Set a target goal for your blood sugar levels for different times during the day. This helps you manage your blood sugar.
Decide how often you need to check your blood sugar at home.
If your blood sugar is higher than your goals over three days and you don't know why, check your urine for ketones. Then contact your provider.

Managing Diabetes and Heart Disease

Having diabetes means you are more likely to develop heart disease and to have a greater chance of a heart attack or a stroke. Over time, high blood glucose from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart. Adults with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to die from heart disease or stroke as people without diabetes. The good news is that the steps you take to manage your diabetes also help to lower your chances of having heart disease or a stroke.

Key Steps to Manage Diabetes and Reduce Heart Disease Risk
Manage your A1C, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol Levels

Ask your healthcare team what your goals should be for A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
Develop or Maintain Healthy Lifestyle Habits

Follow your healthy eating plan and make physical activity part of your routine.
Learn Ways to Manage Stress

Try deep breathing, gardening, taking a walk, doing yoga, or listening to your favorite music.
Stay on Top of Your Medications

Take medicines as prescribed by your doctor.
Stop Smoking or Using Other Tobacco Products

You can start by calling 1-800-QUITNOW or visiting smokefree.gov.

A1C Test
A1C is a lab test that shows the average level of blood sugar (glucose) over the previous 3 months. It indicates how well you are controlling your blood sugar to help prevent complications from diabetes.

How the Test is Performed

A blood sample is needed. Two methods are available:

Blood drawn from a vein: This is done at a lab.
Finger stick: This can be done in your health care provider's office or with a prescribed kit for home use. Results may differ slightly from those of blood drawn from a vein but can be used to monitor treatment.
How to Prepare for the Test

No special preparation is needed. The food you have recently eaten does not affect the A1C test, so fasting is not necessary.

How the Test Will Feel

Finger stick: You may feel slight pain.
Blood drawn from a vein: You may feel a slight pinch or stinging when the needle is inserted, followed by possible throbbing or a slight bruise that soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed

Your provider may order this test if you have diabetes to monitor your control over the condition. It may also be used to screen for diabetes.

Normal Results

When used to diagnose diabetes:

Normal (no diabetes): Less than 5.7%
Pre-diabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%
Diabetes: 6.5% or higher
If you have diabetes, the goal is often to keep the level below 7%. Discuss your specific target range with your provider.

Factors Affecting Results

Conditions such as anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, and certain blood disorders (thalassemia) can affect the results. Certain medications can also result in a false A1C level. Discuss any existing conditions or medications with your provider.

What Abnormal Results Mean

An abnormal result indicates high blood sugar levels over weeks to months.

If A1C is 6.5% or higher and you do not have diabetes, you may be diagnosed with diabetes.
If you have diabetes and your A1C is above 7%, your blood sugar control may need improvement. Discuss with your provider to determine your target A1C.
Estimated Average Glucose (eAG)

Some labs use A1C to calculate an eAG, which may differ from your actual blood sugar readings from a glucose meter or continuous glucose monitor. Actual readings are usually more reliable.

Risks

There is little risk involved with blood tests. Potential risks include:

Excessive bleeding
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Fainting or lightheadedness
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (slight risk whenever skin is broken)
Alternative Names

HbA1C test
Glycated hemoglobin test
Glycohemoglobin test
Hemoglobin A1C
Diabetes - A1C
Diabetic - A1C

What Is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough—or any—insulin, or doesn't use insulin properly. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.

Diabetes raises the risk for damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. Taking steps to prevent or manage diabetes may lower your risk of developing diabetes health problems.

What are the different types of diabetes?
The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes: If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.

Type 2 diabetes: If you have type 2 diabetes, the cells in your body don't use insulin properly. The pancreas may be making insulin but is not making enough insulin to keep your blood glucose level in the normal range. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you have risk factors such as overweight or obesity and a family history of the disease. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. You can help delay or prevent type 2 diabetes by knowing the risk factors and taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle, such as losing weight or preventing weight gain.

Gestational diabetes: Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you've had gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is type 2 diabetes.

Prediabetes: People with prediabetes have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. You also have a higher risk for heart disease than people with normal glucose levels.

Other types of diabetes: A less common type of diabetes, called monogenic diabetes, is caused by a change in a single gene. Diabetes can also come from having surgery to remove the pancreas or from damage to the pancreas due to conditions such as cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis.

How common are diabetes and prediabetes?
More than 133 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes.

As of 2019, 37.3 million people—or 11.3% of the U.S. population—had diabetes. More than 1 in 4 people over the age of 65 had diabetes. Nearly 1 in 4 adults with diabetes didn't know they had the disease.
About 90% to 95% of diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes.
In 2019, 96 million adults—38% of U.S. adults—had prediabetes.
What other health problems can people with diabetes develop?
Over time, high blood glucose can damage your heart, kidneys, feet, and eyes. If you have diabetes, you can take steps to lower your chances of developing diabetes health problems by taking steps to improve your health and learning how to manage the disease. Managing your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels can help prevent future health problems.
